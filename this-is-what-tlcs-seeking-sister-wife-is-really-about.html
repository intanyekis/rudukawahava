Since the show first aired in 2010, Sister Wives has grown a huge following of dedicated viewers. Sister Wives follows the life of Kane Brown and wives Meri Brown, Janelle Brown, Robyn Brown, and now ex-wife Christine Brown. In 2018, TLC chose to capitalize on the success of Sister Wives and create a new show about polygamist relationships. Seeking Sister Wife is currently airing its fourth season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Seeking Sister Wife has a very different structure than Sister Wives. Instead of only following one family, Seeking Sister Wife follows the journey of multiple families as they attempt to bring in another member to their relationships. Several couples have been featured on multiple seasons, while others have been brought on each season. Let’s get into what Seeking Sister Wives is all about.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is Kody Brown’s Favorite Sister Wife? A Look Into His Relationship With Each Wife</a></span></p><h2 id=seeking-sister-wife-follows-many-families><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Seeking Sister Wife Follows Many Families</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unlike the original Sister Wives show on TLC, Seeking Sister Wife does not limit itself to one family. Instead, <a href=#>the show follows multiple couples</a> as each attempt to bring another party into their relationships. Some couples are looking for a third party, while others already have multiple sister wives and are hoping to expand.</p><p>Several couples have been featured on multiple seasons of the show since their attempts at dating a new sister wife have failed. For example, Dimitri and Ashley Snowden appeared on the first three seasons of the show. Seeking Sister Wife is currently airing its forth season.</p><h2 id=the-potential-wife-for-alldredge-family-faked-her-death><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Potential Wife For Alldredge Family Faked Her Death</span></h2><p>One of the most bizarre scandals to come out of TLC’s Seeking Sister Wife involved the Alldredge family in their attempts to find a sister wife. During their time in the first two seasons of the show, Jeff Alldredge and his wives Vanessa and Sharis met Jennifer Linnerth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jennifer Linnerth was not liked amongst fans, but no one suspected what happened. Linnerth left a meeting with the Alldredge family and claimed to have a family emergency. While trying to set up another meeting, she claimed to have a ruptured appendix. A family member of Linnerth then texted the Alldredges to say Linnerth had died. Linnerth faked the whole thing.</p><h2 id=why-were-the-brineys-not-in-season-2-of-seeking-sister-wife><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Why Were The Brineys Not In Season 2 Of Seeking Sister Wife?</span></h2><p>Drew Briney and his three sister wives were featured in season 1 of Seeking Sister Wife. Drew had been married to April for 20 years before they began their polygamist relationship with Auralee and Angela. Season 1 showcased April’s issues with the other two wives, and it was clear that the three did not get along. <a href=#>The Brown family from Sister Wives can relate to wives not getting along</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Briney’s were set to be in season 2 of the TLC show, but April threw a wrench in that plan. April abruptly decided to divorce Drew and leave the Briney family while shooting the second season. Producers did not think her exit suited the show, so the whole family was cut from the second season.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>‘Sister Wives’ Kody Speculated That Now Ex-Wife Christine May Have Been Having ‘Mid-Life Crisis’</a></span></p><h2 id=seeking-sister-wife-39-s-christeline-petersen-accused-snowdens-of-abuse><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Seeking Sister Wife's Christeline Petersen Accused Snowdens Of Abuse</span></h2><p>After two seasons of failing to find a third party for their polygamist relationship, Dimitri and Ashley Snowden found Christeline Petersen in season 3 of Seeking Sister Wife. Dimitri married Peterson at the end of season 3, but their happiness quickly dissolved.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Peterson divorced the Snowdens and filed for a restraining order from both Dimitri and Ashley in March 2021. She claimed Dimitri had woken her up by “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">slamming my head into the headboard of the bed and he was yelling at me</a>.” The physical abuse occurred multiple times, and Ashley had also “shoved me to prevent me from leaving” and “threw a bottle at me.”</p><h2 id=why-did-ashley-leave-dimitri-snowden-on-seeking-sister-wife><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Why Did Ashley Leave Dimitri Snowden On Seeking Sister Wife?</span></h2><p>Unsurprisingly, Ashely and Dimitri Snowden were met with a lot of backlash following Christeline Petersen’s accusations of domestic violence. Following the finale of season 3 of Seeking Sister Wife and the split from Petersen, <a href=#>Ashley announced she had left Dimitri</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Dimitri has deleted his social media in the wake of the controversy, Ashley has been very active in sharing what her life is like now. She has taken time to heal from her failed relationships and is focused on her career as a wellness coach. Ashley is currently living a drama-free and reality-show-free life.</p><h2 id=seeking-sister-wife-39-s-nick-april-and-jennifer-all-sleep-in-one-bed><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Seeking Sister Wife's Nick, April, And Jennifer All Sleep In One Bed</span></h2><p>Newcomers to season 4 of Seeking Sister Wife, Nick, April, and Jennifer Davis court Danielle to be their third sister wife. Nick, April, and Jennifer have an interesting dynamic, as they all live under the same roof—<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">and sleep in the same bed</a>!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite sharing one bed, the Davis’s are adamant that they are not polyamorous. April and Jennifer have individual relationships with Nick. April and Jennifer are married to each other to showcase their commitment to each other as sister wives, but they all share Nick’s last name. Jennifer recently revealed that she is pregnant.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sister Wives: Kody Brown’s Wives And Kids All Seem To Be Fed Up With Him</a></span></p><h2 id=sidian-and-tosha-jones-have-a-dark-past><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Sidian And Tosha Jones Have A Dark Past</span></h2><p>Sidian and Tosha Jones first entered Seeking Sister Wife in season 3. They are now continuing their journey in season 4 with an international long-distance relationship with Ariel. Though they seem like a normal couple looking for a polygamous lifestyle, fans are starting to suspect otherwise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tosha was allegedly charged with felony theft in 2016. Though she was only given unsupervised probation, this charge called her character into question for many fans. Sidian’s past is also quite dark. He was previously with Lavandulou Seymour and claimed the relationship was polygamous. Seymour has since said “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I was in no way interested in polygamy</a>” while they were together and Sidian was “unfaithful.”</p><h2 id=who-are-the-newest-families-in-seeking-sister-wife><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Who Are The Newest Families In Seeking Sister Wife?</span></h2><p>Since Seeking Sister Wife is structured around couples finding new sister wives, once they find their match or give up, they are no longer featured on the show. This is the reason why the show has had so much cast turnover during its four seasons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The now-airing season 4 of Seeking Sister Wife features three new families. The previously discussed Davis family are hoping for a third sister wife. Steve and Brenda Foley are looking for a much younger sister wife to complete their family. The Epps family, which is comprised of Marcus, Taryn, and India, are looking for a new addition as well. The Merrifield family and Jones family are continuing their journeys from last season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroaGjYra0edahmK1lpKGwtHnSnpykoZ6cerS10q2cq2WnnrOmecisZKudkaG5unnAm6aurF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./where-was-places-in-the-heart-filmed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where was Places in the Heart Filmed?
