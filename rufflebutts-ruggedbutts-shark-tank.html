Unable to find a similar product for her own children, she saw an opportunity to fill a gap in the market. In 2007, she and her husband Mark established RuffleButts, focusing on affordability, fashion, and quality. In 2011, they launched RuggedButts, a clothing line for boys. RuffleButts and RuggedButts have grown rapidly over the years, with annual revenues reaching millions of dollars by their fifth year. The brands are available in hundreds of retailers worldwide.</p><h3>Why Rufflebutts?</h3><p>Amber Schaub’s personal experience played a significant role in the birth of RuffleButts. Growing up, she cherished the adorable ruffled bloomers she wore as a child. However, when she couldn’t find a similar product for her own children, Amber decided to create her own line of ruffled clothing. This decision led to the creation of RuffleButts, a brand that captures the charm and nostalgia of ruffled bloomers while offering modern, stylish designs.</p><p>“RuffleButts was born out of a desire to provide adorable and affordable ruffled clothing for children, just like the ones I loved wearing as a child.” – Amber Schaub</p><p>RuffleButts quickly gained popularity for its unique and playful designs. The brand’s commitment to affordability, fashion, and quality resonated with parents worldwide, leading to its rapid growth and expansion. In 2011, RuggedButts was introduced to cater to the needs of boys, further solidifying RuffleButts’ position as a leading children’s clothing brand.</p><p>RuffleButts and RuggedButts have become go-to choices for parents looking to dress their children in stylish, comfortable, and high-quality clothing. The brands offer a wide range of ruffled and rugged apparel for boys and girls, ensuring that every child can enjoy fashionable and fun outfits. Today, RuffleButts and RuggedButts are available in numerous retailers worldwide, spreading joy and style to children and parents everywhere.</p><h2>Rufflebutts Shark Tank Pitch</h2><p>During their appearance on Shark Tank, founders of RuffleButts, Amber and Mark Schaub, presented a compelling pitch to secure an investment for their company. They sought a $600,000 investment in exchange for a 7% stake in RuffleButts. At the time of the pitch, RuffleButts was valued at $8.6 million, with impressive annual sales of $3.7 million.</p><p>“We believe that RuffleButts has tremendous potential to become a leader in the children’s clothing market. Our products offer unique designs, affordability, and quality, catering to the fashion-forward preferences of parents and caregivers.”</p><p><b>Lori Greiner</b>, one of the esteemed Sharks, recognized the value of RuffleButts and offered $600,000 for a slightly higher equity stake of 9%. The deal was accepted by Amber and Mark during the show, showcasing their ambition and commitment to further grow their business.</p><p>However, as it happens in the world of entrepreneurial ventures, not all deals made on the show come to fruition. The agreement between RuffleButts and <b>Lori Greiner</b> did not fully materialize after the Shark Tank episode aired. Nevertheless, this setback did not deter the success and progress of RuffleButts.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rufflebutts-Shark-Tank-Update-1024x585.jpg alt="Rufflebutts Shark Tank Update" title="Rufflebutts Shark Tank Update" width=1024 height=585 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Since their appearance on Shark Tank, RuffleButts has experienced continuous prosperity. The brand has shown remarkable resilience and achieved impressive milestones. As of August 2021, RuffleButts boasts annual sales of $6 million, demonstrating the company’s ability to thrive and grow despite the challenges they faced in securing a deal with Lori Greiner.</p><p>RuffleButts has proved that the Shark Tank experience, while highly valuable, is not the sole determinant of a company’s success.
