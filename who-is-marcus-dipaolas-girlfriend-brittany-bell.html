He was born in China and moved to the United States when he was 16.</p><p>Marcus has spent the last 11 years of his career covering the judiciary, executive, and legislative branches of government at the local, state, and federal levels.</p><p>He has visited 26 countries till now and thus has vast experience with both his government and the governments of other countries. He occasionally uses his platform to share his thoughts with the public, but he often shares breaking news with them.&nbsp;</p><h2>Quick Facts About Marcus DiPaola</h2><table class="table table-bordered content-table"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Name</strong></td><td>Marcus DiPaola</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Born</strong></td><td>May 4, 1991</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Instagram Followers</strong></td><td>90.9k</td></tr><tr><td><strong>TikTok Followers</strong></td><td>3.7 million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>YouTube subscribers</strong></td><td>17.9k</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Partner</strong></td><td>Brittany Bella</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td>$1 million</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=who-is-marcus-dipaolas-gi>Who Is Marcus DiPaola's Girlfriend, Brittany Bell?</h2><p>Marcus DiPaola is dating his girlfriend<strong> Brittany Bell</strong>, who went viral through his comedy video. She is an animal rescuer whose videos can be found on DiPaola's YouTube channel.</p><p>The video of him introducing his girlfriend spawned a wave of duets that resulted in the creation of multiple duets on TikTok.</p><p>TikTok's most notable feature is its community of creatively funny people. TikTok is the only social platform that allows anyone to take someone else's video and use it to create their own unique story.&nbsp;Marcus uploaded a new TikTok on May 4th, 2021, Star Wars Day, introducing his girlfriend to his large followers. It's a fairly normal video, but TikTok has its mind.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/10/1a484393-1fff-4ce6-b101-341cbcf9c53c.webp></p><p>One of the top commenters on the original video thought Brittany looked terrified, as if she were being held, hostage.</p><p>This sparked a new duet trend in which people added their contributions to make it appear as if there was a hostage situation in Marcus's room.&nbsp;When a dueter took a Nerf gun and pointed it at Brittany's head, it was the initial video to flourish the idea of a hostage situation.</p><a title=@b8esportsgg href=#>@b8esportsgg</a> @marcus.dipaola #<a title=dendipudge href=#>dendipudge </a>#<a title=esport href=#>esport </a>#<a title=acid href=#>acid</a> <a title="♬ original sound - B8 Esports" href=#>♬ original sound - B8 Esports</a><p>This video marked the start of something much bigger than just that one duet. It quickly progressed to more random but amusing duet contributions, such as adding limbs that are not visible in the frame.</p><p>The trend has spread across multiple timelines, but they all revolve around the same idea: a hostage situation, and Brittany is in danger. From SWAT teams to people pretending to watch other people's TikToks on their TVs, it quickly grew to have as much lore and offshoots as Star Wars.</p><p>Following the video, he never posted anything related to Brittany and had solely dedicated his account to news purposes.&nbsp;People may often confuse her with Nick Cannon's wife, Brittany Bell, but they are two different people.</p><p>The Masked Singer host, 41, and Bell welcomed their third child, Cannon's tenth child, in September 2022.</p><h2 id=does-marcus-dipaola-have->What Disability Does Marcus DiPaola Have?</h2><p>Netizens were confused that Marcus DiPaola had learning disabilities.</p><p>But he doesn't, in fact, he once mentioned in a tweet that he writes for middle school students with learning disabilities.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/10/c61002e6-ed39-4493-aa6c-51b0cfbec78e.webp></p><p>While some <a href=# rel=noopener>people</a> find it amusing that he reports the middle schoolers with disabilities, before turning around and telling those middle schoolers how many women he boinks at the same time.</p><p>Some people are praising him for his work.</p><h2 id=marcus-dipaolas-net-worth>Marcus DiPaola's Net Worth, How Rich Is The American TikToker?</h2><p>Marcus DiPaola is an American TikToker who has a net worth of <strong>$1 million.</strong></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Sportskeeda</a> reported Dipaola could earn up to $2,000 per post on TikTok, besides the brand-sponsored deals.</p><p>On Instagram, he could earn up to $5,000 for a brand-sponsored post. His average earnings on YouTube are around $2,000 per video, excluding brand-sponsored deals, for which he could charge up to $5,000 per video.</p><p>He also earns passive income from royalties on footage shot over the last 11 years of his life that major newspapers, TV networks, Hollywood films, and advertisers purchase to use without attribution. He also has a Patreon account, where you can support him.</p><p>Marcus' breaking news on TikTok has earned him over 3.7 million followers on the platform. He is a freelance field reporter currently based in Brooklyn, New York.&nbsp;According to his bio, he worked for mainstream news outlets for 11 years. The New York Times, Xinhua News Agency, ABC News, NBC News, and others have used Marcus' work.</p><p>Marcus covered the WhiteHouse for four years before anchoring the news on TikTok, primarily aimed at middle schoolers with learning disabilities.</p><p>DiPaola's TikTok journalism format consists of a 20-to-60-second video clip posted every day. &nbsp;His most recent story about serial killer Wesley Brownly has received 2.4 million views.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/10/818a9ed0-94d6-4ea0-8df2-fe0c6601cf82.webp></p><p>He also uploads the same in the YouTube shorts, where he has 17.9 k subscribers.</p><p>Though he is unaffiliated with major media outlets, viewers rely on his interpretations of national headlines. "I want to be the bridge between mainstream media and teenagers," DiPaola told the Washington Post.</p><p>On election night in October 2020, he began posting on TikTok. He took advantage of the opportunity to share the news as the public awaited the results while news channels were slow to update.&nbsp;DiPaola started posting polling updates every hour based on FiveThirtyEight's presidential forecast vertical. Following that, he quickly went viral.</p><h2>Some FAQs</h2><h3 class=m-0>What Is The Relation between Marcus DiPaola And Disability?</h3>Marcus' news script format is intended to assist middle school students with learning disabilities in comprehending the news.<h3 class=m-0>What Is Marcus DiPaola's Net Worth In 2022?</h3>Marcus DiPaola has an estimated net worth of $1 million as of 2022.<h3 class=m-0>Who Is The Happy Star Wars Day Guy?</h3>Happy Star Wars Day guy is Marcus DiPaola who went viral on the Star Wars day while he was introducing his girlfriend to his followers.<h3 class=m-0>Who Is Marcus DiPaola?</h3>Marcus DiPaola is the host of News 101 on Snapchat who also covers breaking news on TikTok.<h3 class=m-0>Who Is Marcus DiPaola's Girlfriend, Brittany Bell?</h3>Marcus DiPaola's Girlfriend, Brittany Bell is an animal rescuer.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirmKTEo7XZnKarppWne6S7zGiuoaddnsBuucCrmq6rXZm2sa3OpZisZZeev62y0aKcp5xdl7%2BqwNOapbJlkpq5rQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./halle-berry-shares-saucy-valentines-day-video-with-boyfriend-van-hunt.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Halle Berry Shares Saucy Valentines Day Video With Boyfriend Van Hunt">&larr;
