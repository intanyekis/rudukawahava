Everyone knows that Teresa Giudice and her fellow housewife and sister-in-law Melissa Gorga have dealt with some struggles throughout the year. Ahead of Season 13, it’s looking like a lot is about to change for the state of their relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from the family drama that has always plagued RHONJ, there’s been a few things that have shifted since we last watched the show. We’re talking new housewives, relationships, and a whole new marriage! So, what <a href=#>has changed</a> since you last watched Season 12 of RHONJ? In short, lots.</p><h2 id=dolores-has-a-new-boyfriend><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Dolores Has A New Boyfriend</span></h2><p>While we found out at the Season 12 RHONJ reunion that Dolores Catania had a new boo, it’s clear that their relationship has gotten pretty serious. The two always take to Instagram to share cute pictures together. Dolores' man is set to appear on the upcoming season of RHONJ, and we can’t wait to see how the two interact.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dolores-amp-frank-rsquo-s-relationship-has-changed><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Dolores & Frank’s Relationship Has Changed</span></h2><p>Based on the Season 13 trailer, it’s looking like Dolores’ relationship with her ex-husband, Frank Catania, is going through some changes. The trailer places a heavy emphasis on the two, with clips showing Frank saying, “I miss our relationship.” Everyone now knows that Dolores has a new boyfriend in her life, and it’ll be interesting to see how their relationship pans out in the new season. However, we really think that the trailer has heightened the “drama” set to endure between Dolores and Frank… these two have and always will be on good terms.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Makes Each Series Of 'The Real Housewives' Different?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=margaret-amp-jennifer-are-still-feuding><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Margaret & Jennifer Are *Still* Feuding</span></h2><p>No matter how many times <a href=#>Margaret Josephs</a> and Jennifer Aydin attempt to make up, it seems that the two always end up going head-to-head time after time. Since these two met, they’ve just never been able to get along. When Margaret exposed Jennifer’s husband's affair, their relationship got even rockier. The Season 13 trailer shows us that their Season 12 drama is definitely going to spill over into the new season.</p><h2 id=teresa-got-married><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Teresa Got Married</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Oh yes, we’re sure you know, but <a href=#>Teresa Giudice</a> has gotten engaged and married since you last saw RHONJ. While Teresa was already engaged to Luis Ruelas by the Season 12 reunion, the two are now officially married. You may be wondering… will we see Teresa and Luis get married on the upcoming season of RHONJ? The answer to your question is no. However, viewers will still be able to watch the two tie the knot as they filmed a miniseries of the special occasion. So get ready, because after Season 13 of New Jersey ends, we will have an exclusive wedding series to watch.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These 8 Real Housewives Were All Born Under The Sign Of Taurus</a></span></p><h2 id=two-news-housewives-have-joined-the-group><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Two News Housewives Have Joined The Group</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the debut of Season 13 of RHONJ comes the introduction of not one but two new housewives! That’s right – we’re getting our first cast mix up since Season 9. <a href=#>Rachel Fuda and Danielle Cabra</a> are the newest housewives of New Jersey. It’s looking like these two ladies are going to bring a lot to the new season, and we can’t wait to see what they have in store for us.</p><h2 id=jackie-goldschneider-will-now-be-a-39-friend-39><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jackie Goldschneider Will Now Be A 'Friend'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After being a full-time housewife since Season 9, Jackie Goldschneider will become a “friend of” to the New Jersey housewives. During Season 12, Jackie opened up about her struggles with an eating disorder. Throughout the duration of filming Season 13, Jackie explained that it was best for her to focus on her recovery instead of the reality television show. “I just wasn't sure how to balance the time commitment for the show with my recovery,” <a href=#>she told People</a>. We’re glad that Jackie was able to take a step back and prioritize her health. Still, we can’t wait to see her in Season 13 of RHONJ.</p><h2 id=teresa-melissa-amp-joe-had-a-huge-falling-out><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Teresa, Melissa, & Joe Had A Huge Falling Out</span></h2><p>It’s the news that almost every single Bravo fan was shocked to hear when it came out: Melissa and Joe Gorga did not attend Teresa’s wedding. Apparently, some <a href=#>intense drama</a> goes down between the family during Season 13 of RHONJ that leads to the Gorga’s not attending Teresa’s wedding. We’ll have to wait to watch and see what happens between this family, but it breaks our hearts that they’re still <a href=#>not on the greatest of terms</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>8 Times The Real Housewives of New Jersey Made Housewives History</a></span></p><h2 id=so-a-lot-has-changed-since-you-last-saw-rhonj><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>So, A Lot Has Changed Since You Last Saw RHONJ</span></h2><p>It’s safe to say that a lot has changed since the last time you saw RHONJ. From the introduction of new faces to <a href=#>family conflict</a>, if there’s one thing we can always count on the New Jersey housewives to be, it’s entertaining. We can’t wait for the season to get rolling, but we’re going to be devastated when it does come to an end.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWiv4ycn5qml5qxbr7HqKWjZaOarrS7zWZobGc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./andrew-lincoln-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Andrew Lincoln Net Worth">&larr;
