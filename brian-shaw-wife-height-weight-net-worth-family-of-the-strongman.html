He also gained admission into Arizona State University for his Master’s degree program but opted out to build his strongman career.</p><p>Brian Shaw was introduced to strength sports in July 2005 through his encounter with Richard Sorin, the founder of Sorinex, a corporation that produces weightlifting structures for Denver Broncos after Shaw lifted 172 pounds Thomas Inch’s dumbbell with one hand in his presence. Three months later, he made his first strongman appearance in the Denver Strongest Man contest and emerged the winner without any formalised training.</p><p>The 6 feet 8 inches athlete eventually turned pro in June 2006 after barely nine months of his introduction to the strength sport and began his journey to become the strongest man in the world. It didn’t take him long to establish himself as a force to be reckoned with as he began breaking and setting several records.</p><p>The year 2009 was a great year for him as he clinched many strongman titles including emerging the winner of All-American Strongman Challenge, Los Angeles Grand Prix, Gothenburg Grand Prix and the Overall Champion of the Strongman Super Series. In addition to that, Brian Shaw went on to become the first modern competitor to clinch both the World’s Strongest Man and Arnold Strongman Classic titles the same calendar year.
