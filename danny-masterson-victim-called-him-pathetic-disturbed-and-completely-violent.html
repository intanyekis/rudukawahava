Trout, one of the two women whom the “That 70s Show” star was convicted of raping in his Hollywood-area home in 2003.</p><p>“That’s what rape is, a theft of the spirit.”</p><p>The woman, whose identity was not fully revealed because she was a victim of a sex crime, had been raped so viciously that she threw up in her mouth, prosecutors had revealed.</p><p>She called the actor “pathetic, disturbed, and completely violent” as his <a href=#>distraught wife, Bijou Phillips</a>,&nbsp;looked on before he was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sentenced to 30 years behind bars</a>.</p><p>“The world is better off with you in prison.</p><p>“You relish in hurting women. It is your addiction. It is without question your favorite thing to do,” N. Trout read in her victim impact statement Thursday.</p><p>“Life is precious and fragile. Find your heart … Learn something. Read books. Listen to the brightness of nothing and get well.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Actor Danny Masterson was sentenced Thursday to 30 years in prison for raping two women in 2003. <span class=credit>KAT / MEGA</span></figure><p>Still, she told him: “I forgive you.”</p><p>His other victim, only identified in court as Jen B., also told Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Charlaine Olmedo on Thursday that the actor “has not shown an ounce of remorse for the pain he caused.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The actor was convicted of violently raping the two women at his Hollywood home.

I wish I’d reported him sooner to the police.”</p><p>Prosecutors laid out how Masterson used his celebrity and prominence in the Church of Scientology — where his victims were also members — to skirt the law and avoid accountability.</p><p>“Sorry, Leah’s not behind this,” Jen B. said, referencing actress Leah Remini, a former member of the church who has become an outspoken critic.&nbsp;</p><p>The victims testified that they were given drinks by Masterson that made them pass out, and he proceeded to <a href=#>rape them</a>.</p><p>Prosecutors said N. Trout was raped so viciously that she threw up in her mouth and begged Masterson to at least use a condom.</p><p>When the women <a href=#>reported Masterson to Scientology officials</a>, they were told they were not raped and were put through an ethics program.</p><p>They told the court that Scientology officials also warned them not to report the crime to the police because Masterson was such a high-ranking member of the church.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Defense attorneys claimed the sexual acts were consensual. <span class=credit>KAT / MEGA</span></figure><p>Masterson has denied any wrongdoing but did not testify in court, nor did his lawyers call any witnesses to the stand.</p><p>Instead, the defense argued that the sexual acts were consensual, and accused the women of coordinating stories to discredit the former Hollywood star.</p><p>The actor was never charged with any counts of drugging, and there is no toxicology evidence to back up the women’s story.</p><p>The Church of Scientology has also denied any wrongdoing, saying in a statement following the sentencing it has “no policy prohibiting or discouraging members from reporting criminal conduct to anyone — Scientologists or not — to law enforcement.”</p><p>It also denied ever harassing either of the women.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized">Prosecutors laid out how Masterson used his celebrity and prominence in the Church of Scientology — where his victims were also members — to skirt the law and avoid accountability. <span class=credit>FOX</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Masterson rose to fame on “That 70s Show,” which also starred Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher and Topher Grace. <span class=credit>ROBERT SEBREE/FOX</span></figure><p>But one of the women told reporters after the hearing Thursday how she was shunned and ostracized for going to authorities in 2004.</p><p>“I lost everything. I lost my religion. I lost my ability to contact anyone I’d known or loved my entire life,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>“I didn’t exist outside the Scientology world, I had to start my life over at 29. It seemed the world I knew didn’t want me to live.”</p><p>Trout also said, following the sentencing, “I don’t have to carry your shame around with me anymore. Now you have to hold that shame. You have to sit in a cell and hold it.”</p><p>With Post wires</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3JmaXBfma6vuthmpJqrpJq%2FtLvNZq2im6Seum6vwKWjnpxdnbauec%2Baq6GdpJ6wbrDIrKuuqpKasW6tzZ1knKedpbmmwMSlsGaumaS5prrTaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jets-have-long-shot-options-if-top-qb-targets-dont-work-out.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jets have long-shot options if top QB targets don't work out">&larr;
