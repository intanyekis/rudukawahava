Every year Forbes releases a list of the most valuable teams in the world. This is a multi-billionaire business and the value of a sports franchise depends on several factors: the team's results, sponsorships, and annual revenue&nbsp;being a few of them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>RELATED:&nbsp; <a href=#>10 Richest Sports Team Owners In America (And How Much They're Worth)</a></p><p>Each&nbsp;team on this list is worth billions of dollars and all they are mostly from the U.S. and Europe. Curious? Keep scrolling and discover the most valuable teams in the world, according to Forbes.</p><h2 id=new-york-giants---3-3-billion>New York Giants - $3.3 Billion</h2><p>The New York Giants&nbsp;are worth an impressive $3.3 billion, the same amount&nbsp;as last year. The team won four NFL Championships and four Super Bowls. It was created in 1925, and the Mara family bought the franchise for $500, an investment that would make them billionaires. According to Forbes, the team now belongs to John Mara and Steve Tisch.</p><p>Mara intends to do some changes&nbsp;with the team. "You don't like to see all of that talent go out the door," Mara said&nbsp;to Tom Rock of Newsday. "But let's face it, we've had one <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">winning season</a>, 2016, here and the other five or six years have not been so good since we won that last Super Bowl. So, we needed some drastic changes."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=golden-state-warriors---3-5-billion>Golden State Warriors - $3.5 Billion</h2><p>The Golden State Warriors are worth $3.5 billion and&nbsp;that total increased $400 million compared to last year. The basketball team belongs to multimillionaires Joe Lacob and Peter Guber and has a $401 Million annual revenue. The Warriors have an impressive income of $2 billion that comes from season tickets, suites, and sponsorship contracts, according to Forbes.</p><p>The team has won six championships so far and is the third most valuable NBA franchise. The team has prominent stars like Draymond Green and Stephen Curry.</p><h2 id=los-angeles-lakers---3-7-billion>Los Angeles Lakers - $3.7 Billion</h2><p>According to Forbes, the average value of an NBA team is $1.9 billion. The amount represents a 13 percent increase if compared with the previous year. However, some teams can reach much higher amounts. The Los Angeles Lakers, for example, are worth $3.7 billion and&nbsp;are one of the most influential teams in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the team might fall&nbsp;a bit down&nbsp;the 2020 list. Earlier this year, Magic Johnson left his position&nbsp;as president of basketball operations and created a <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">public drama</a> with the owners. It&nbsp;has slightly tarnished the image of the team.</p><h2 id=new-england-patriots---3-8-billion>New England Patriots&nbsp;- 3.8 Billion</h2><p>The billionaire Robert Kraft paid <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$172</a> million for the New England Patriots. It was one of the best investments Kraft ever&nbsp;made and today the team is worth $3.8 billion and is the 6th most valuable pro franchise in the world.</p><p>"My objective in buying the Patriots is to help bring a championship to New England," Kraft told<a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> CNN</a>.</p><p>A&nbsp;significant part of Patriot's success is thanks to Tom Brady and coach Bill Belichick. Since 1994, the team has won the Super Bowl six times.</p><h2 id=manchester-united---3-8-billion>Manchester United - $3.8 Billion</h2><p>Manchester United is still one of the most valuable teams on Earth and it is worth $3.8 billion. However, it is a significant decrease if compared to the $4.12 billion it was worth <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">last year</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The British team is not doing the best at the moment. It ended in the 6th position at the Premier League and they might be out of the Champions League next year if they are found guilty of breaking financial rules. If they don't recover, there are chances the team falls down a few positions in this list next year.</p><h2 id=new-york-knicks---4-billion>New York Knicks - $4 Billion</h2><p>The New York Knicks&nbsp;are the most valuable basketball team in the world and&nbsp;are worth <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$4 billion</a>. The amount represents an 11 percent increase if compared with the previous year.</p><p>The team belongs to the billionaire James Dolan. During an interview to ESPN, the entrepreneur revealed that someone offered $5 billion for the team, but he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">didn't find the value appealing</a>.</p><p>"You hear numbers all the time," Dolan told ESPN. " I think people have sent feelers out, but never any that were pursued. Yeah, [the feelers are] around that number [$5 billion], but those things, it's like a stock price. It's only important if you're going to buy or sell."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=barcelona---4-02-billion>Barcelona - $4.02 Billion</h2><p>Barcelona is worth <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$4.06&nbsp;billion</a> and is one of the most valuables teams in Europe. The Spanish giant invests millions on players like Lionel Messi, the highest-paid athlete in the world, and Luiz Suares. The team also had other A-list names, like Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp; <a href=#>10 Rules Lionel Messi Followed To Become The Highest-Paid Soccer Player In The World</a></span></p><p>Unsurprisingly, it is one of the most popular teams in the world and they have countless supporters outside Spain.

Although it is an astronomical value, many people will be surprised that it is not in the first place.

The second position is the LA Dodgers that has a $517 annual revenue, almost $200 million less than the New York Yankees.

Dallas is in the first position since 2016 and also has the highest profit that comes from sponsorships and seating revenue at its AT&T Stadium. In 2017, they made $365 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dallas Cowboys belongs to the billionaire and entrepreneur Jerry Jones, who owns the team since 1989.
