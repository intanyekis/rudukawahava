This platform featured captivating vlogs that showcased the beautiful chaos of their family life, highlighting their six wonderful children – Shari, Chad, Julie, Eve, Russell, and Abby.

Through their relatable stories and endearing adventures, Ruby Franke’s early triumphs on YouTube played a significant role in her ascent to success and the accumulation of her net worth.</p><h2>Controversies Surrounding 8 Passengers and Ruby Franke</h2><p>Despite the success of 8 Passengers, the channel has faced severe criticism for showcasing Ruby and Kevin Franke’s questionable parenting methods. Viewers have reported instances of alleged child abuse, including accusations that Ruby starved her daughter and implemented problematic punishments for their children.</p><p>“The welfare of children should be a top priority for any parent,” says child psychologist Dr. Lisa Johnson. “It is concerning to see instances where parenting practices raise red flags and potentially put children at risk.”</p><p>These controversies eventually led to the deletion of the 8 Passengers channel, as the allegations sparked a wave of public scrutiny and legal <b>consequences</b> for Ruby Franke.</p><p>To better understand the extent of the controversies, let’s take a closer look at the specific incidents that garnered attention:</p><li><strong>Starvation Allegations:</strong> Ruby faced backlash when an episode of their vlogs showed her daughter visibly malnourished. Concerned viewers expressed outrage over the potential neglect and questioned the parenting choices made by Ruby and <b>Kevin Franke</b>.</li><li><strong>Problematic Punishments:</strong> Another point of contention was the disciplinary actions taken by Ruby and Kevin.

The channel aimed to provide support and counseling for parents. However, the content on ConneXions also received criticism for promoting extremist and authoritarian rhetoric, damaging advice, and alleged racist, ableist, homophobic, and transphobic remarks made by both Ruby Franke and <b>Jodi Hildebrandt</b>.</p><p>“Collaborating with <b>Jodi Hildebrandt</b> on ConneXions has been a great opportunity for us to offer valuable support and guidance for parents. We believe in creating a welcoming and inclusive community where families can find resources to navigate the challenges of parenting.”</p><p>Despite their intentions, the content on ConneXions has sparked controversy and backlash from viewers.
