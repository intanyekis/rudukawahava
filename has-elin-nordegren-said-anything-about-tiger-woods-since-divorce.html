In fact, she seemed level-headed during every interview she gave post-split, despite the turmoil that she had gone through.She's also been busy <a href=#>building a life that's very different</a> from that of Mrs. Woods.But has she said anything else about Tiger since their divorce?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elin-nordegren-has-only-given-two-interviews-post-divorce>Elin Nordegren Has Only Given Two Interviews Post-Divorce</h2><p>Though spectators were hoping for more details about the former couple's marital drama, Elin Nordegren has only ever given two interviews since splitting from Tiger Woods.</p><p>As People recapped, Elin spoke to the publication only two times, and hasn't sat down with an interviewer since.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interviews took place in 2010 and 2014</a>, with Nordegren speaking exclusively to People and answering some tough questions.</p><p>The 2010 interview occurred right after the former couple's divorce was finalized; at the time, People could only assume that the settlement Nordegren received was somewhere more than $100M — but no one would say.</p><p>Nordegren only quipped, “Money can’t buy happiness... Or put my family back together." The mom of two also opted to do the interview for the purpose of "setting some things straight."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She discussed being embarrassed that she never suspected Tiger was cheating, and that after finding out, she questioned whether her entire life had been a lie.</p><h2 id=a-second-interview-shed-light-on-elin-s-new-life-without-tiger>A Second Interview Shed Light On Elin's New Life (Without Tiger)</h2><p>In Elin's second interview with People, she had moved into a brand-new home (which People says was built using part of her settlement). She also joked it was the first time she felt she should be in the news.</p><p>Yet she only had positive things to say about Woods, noting, "I have moved on, and I am in a good place. Our relationship is centered around our children, and we are doing really good—we really are. He is a great father."</p><p>Beyond her two interviews, which by now are quite outdated, Elin did mention Tiger once in a public setting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-else-has-elin-nordegren-said-about-tiger-woods>What Else Has Elin Nordegren Said About Tiger Woods?</h2><p>Apart from her two interviews, Elin doesn't seem to have much to say about Tiger. Except she did refer to her divorce during her graduation speech at Rollins College.</p><p>That's right; Elin returned to school after splitting from her ex, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she graduated with a bachelor's degree in psychology</a> (which seems fitting, given her composure and perspective during the divorce and drama).</p><p>In fact, Elin was preparing her speech during that 2014 People interview.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Elin Nordegren Made Double The Cash After Selling Her Former North Palm Beach Home">Elin Nordegren Made Double The Cash After Selling Her Former North Palm Beach Home</a></span></p><p>As HuffPost quoted, Elin talked about her nine-year stint at the school, joking about how she was 25 and only recently transplanted to the US when she began.</p><p>She continued, "Today, nine years later, I'm a proud American and I have two beautiful children.....but I'm no longer married," which elicited laughter from the audience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Elin told her fellow students how education was the one "consistent part" of her life; she took time away to have her two children and also paused in 2010 after Tiger's cheating went public.</p><p>So does the joking nature of her comment mean she's fully forgiven Tiger Woods?</p><h2 id=has-elin-forgiven-tiger>Has Elin Forgiven Tiger?</h2><p>Even in her years-ago interviews, when the pain of the divorce (well, and betrayal) was likely fresh, Elin was very composed and forgiving.</p><p>But that doesn't mean she doesn't have strong feelings about Woods. In the first People interview, she even admitted that they attempted counseling and tried to reconcile.</p><p>Nordegren noted that "months and months" of trying came to nothing because the marriage had no trust or love left.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Did Tiger Woods' Ex-Wife Elin Nordegren Remarry After Their Divorce?">Did Tiger Woods' Ex-Wife Elin Nordegren Remarry After Their Divorce?</a></span></p><p>Those are harsh words, but Tiger deserved them, given his track record. But Elin didn't seem to say it maliciously. Instead, she was reflecting that she had given the marriage her all, and it was simply time to <a href=#>move on and live her own life</a>.</p><p>And based on the fact that Elin has only given those two interviews, then referenced her marriage (and not Tiger by name) in her graduation speech, it seems as if what she said about successfully parenting with Tiger was true.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Who Are Tiger Woods' Kids, Sam And Charlie?">Who Are Tiger Woods' Kids, Sam And Charlie?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given his history and the ways in which he wronged his then-wife, Tiger Woods is lucky that Elin Nordegren was willing to look past that and see him as her kids' father, first, and work on their co-parenting relationship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifmqtdmrmquoynpquclZy%2FprqMrJiinF2Wu7rAx6KloGWRl7y2wIytoKCdomLEsLvDrGSsoZ6Ysm6wyK%2Bmq5uVZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./joe-burrows-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Joe Burrows Net Worth  How Much is Joe Burrow Worth?">&larr;
