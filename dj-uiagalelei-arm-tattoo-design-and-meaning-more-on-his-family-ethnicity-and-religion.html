He started playing football early and is now paving a path toward National Football League (NFL).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Currently, he serves as a quarterback for his college team, Clemson Tigers, at Clemson University. He signed the college contract in 2020. Before that, DJ was a quarterback at St. John Basco High School.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, the young footballer has made headlines after Clemson Tigers won the recent match against Georgia Tech on 5th September 2022. Though his team won, some&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>news portals</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;report that Uiagalelei had a shaky start to the game.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Nonetheless, DJ’s career stats are pretty impressive, and if everything goes well, we will see him as an NFL-drafted quarterback in some years.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dj-uiagalelei-tattoo-on-arm-design-and-meaning-explored></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>DJ Uiagalelei Tattoo On Arm: Design And Meaning Explored</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>DJ Uiagalelei <strong>tattoo</strong> appears pretty big on his arm.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>His tattoo starts right from his right wrist and extends to his elbow, i.e., his tattoo covers his entire arm. Now talking about its design and meaning, he has inked his last name, “Uiagalelei,” in Polynesian tribal patterns and has complemented its design with additional Samoan symbols.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ever since the quarterback inked his right arm, his fans cannot stop talking about it. One of his fans posted a closeup picture of his tattoo and captioned it as&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“Clemson commit DJ Uiagalelei with one of the best tattoos I’ve seen.”</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dj-uiagalelei-family-ethnicity-and-religion></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>DJ Uiagalelei Family: Ethnicity And Religion</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The quarterback was born in a family of&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Samoan</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;ethnicity, and they are&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Christians</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Samoans are the indigenous people from Samoan Island, Polynesia. And DJ’s parents are first-generation Americans whose parents are Samoan Islanders. So, technically, DJ is only the 3rd generation of his tribe living in America.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Additionally, he was born on 17th April 2001 to his parents,&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Dave Uiagalelei</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;(father) and&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Tausha Raquel</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true> (mother). His full name is David John Uiagalelei, and he is 21 years old. Likewise, the quarterback is the eldest son of his parents and has a younger brother, Matayo Uiagalelei.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>According to the&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>source</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, DJ’s father was the bodyguard of different celebrities like Rihana but later became a school resource officer to spend time with his family. Similarly, his mother was a full-time worker and even became a surrogate mother to provide for the family.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Hence, the Uiagalelei family struggled a lot to have a good life for the family. However, the parent’s hard work is fruitful as DJ becomes an exceptional football player. And their younger son Matayo is no less; he also plays football at school.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Previously, the parents never missed their sons’ practice, and now, they never forget their big match. They are always cheering from DJ and Matayo from the crowd.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-dj-uiagalelei-have-girlfriend></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Does DJ Uiagalelei Have Girlfriend</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Yes, DJ Uiagalelei has a girlfriend. She is&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ava Pritchard</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>David and Ava have been dating since 2020. Both of them attend Clemson University and must have initially interacted at college. Likewise, Ava is an athlete like her boyfriend, but she plays college Volleyball.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The couple has made their relationship public, but the quarterback rarely posts about Ava on his social media. The only post he made was wishing her a happy birthday. However, Ava, on the other hand, is pretty vocal and often posts cute couple pictures.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ava’s latest post with DJ was made in June, where the pair looked relaxed in a matching white outfit as DJ walked on with Ava on his back. Ava captioned the photo as </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“my best friend.”</span></p><p><strong>&nbsp;Also Read: Notre Dame: Who Is Tyler Buchner’s Girlfriend Dani Schwartz?
