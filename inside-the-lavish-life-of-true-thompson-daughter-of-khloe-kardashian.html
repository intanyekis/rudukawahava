She makes it her priority to ensure that True is always surrounded by love and this includes her amazing dedication as a mother to co-parent with <a href=#>her boyfriend, Tristan Thompson</a>. Despite the infidelities on the NBA player's end, Khloe seems to make sure that Tristan is a part of True's life which is probably the reason why the couple reconciled. Khloe's love for her daughter is showing with the way she is handling things. Khloe's Instagram is filled with True's photos. The mother-daughter duo always spends time together and even spent the Valentine's Day together wearing some matching clothes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Khloe has experienced being an aunt for years for seven children with Kim and Kourtney's children. So when she finally followed her sisters into the motherhood, she is overwhelmed with joy filling her heart. Three years has passed and the world can see how much Khloe dotes on her daughter by showering her expensive stuff with her motherly love. Let's take a look at the life of True through the years.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>20 Times Khloe Was Too Real About Her Pregnancy (Even For The Kardashians)</a></span></p><h2 id=true-thompson-is-the-miracle-to-khloe-s-life>True Thompson is The Miracle to Khloe’s Life</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>True Thompson came to Khloe’s life as a miracle after she had endured years of infertility so it is not surprising that Khloe makes sure that she treats her like one. Khloe reportedly went on a long and painful road to motherhood before she finally welcomed her first child. She was even so afraid that her pregnancy might not push through so she waited about six months into her pregnancy before she finally announced it on her social media.</p><p>With the hardships she went through to finally get to have a child like True, she makes sure that no expense is spared to spoil her lovely daughter. She showers her with expensive luxury designer clothes and made sure she is living like a princess which is why they are now living in a $37 million mansion. She was even seen letting her daughter wear a $900 Fendi boots and $1,570 Louis Vuitton purse which is a waste of money for some people, but for Khloe, it is just her way of showering True some love.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=luxury-celebrations-and-gifts>Luxury Celebrations and Gifts</h2><p>Once, Khloe posted a Snapchat story where a three month old True is seen wearing a diamond earrings. As early as seven months old, True has been bombarded with luxury items as gifts. Khloe posted on her Instagram account a picture of True where the baby was seen giggling from inside <a href=#>an expensive Hermès Birkin bag</a>. The bag is notoriously pricey and Khloe does not care if True might damage the goods, as long as True is happy. True was also seen in another post where she sits in a sea of about a dozen of luxury bags which is estimated to be valued around $154,000 minimum. Seeing the beautiful girl True playing with a Birkin bag these days is no longer surprising especially to the fans who follow the Kardashians on social media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today, True is seen as a little fashionista dressed in luxurious dresses and bags. Khloe and True loves twinning with their outfit covered with matching luxury branded clothes and bags. The duo has matched outfit numerous times and it is always with designer pieces together. True is growing up with the most luxurious wardrobe. The luxury does not even stop there since Khloe makes sure that every celebration in True’s life is extra. For True’s third birthday last year, Khloe’s daughter was dressed like a princess and she’s surrounded with beautiful pink balloons. Upon arrival, the guests of True are <a href=#>greeted with Disney princess actresses</a> waiting for them at the door.</p><h2 id=extravagant-vacations>Extravagant Vacations</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While growing up with luxurious branded items, True is also growing up loving some extravagant vacations. Khloe loves sharing pictures of their vacation where True is seen enjoying each time. One photo Khloe shared was a whimsical shot of the two of them riding on the horseback during the sunset. This is not something any three years old can experience.&nbsp;<a href=#>These luxurious&nbsp;beach getaways</a> in True's life started as early as four months old, True has been seen having some actions at the beach. Her parents loved to take her to the beach to enjoy sands and the sun. Through the years, the world has seen True’s adventures and vacations as uploaded on her mom’s social media accounts.</p><p>Although Khloe has showered True with luxurious lifestyle, she makes sure that she spends some quality time with True. For Khloe, True is the sweetest angel of her life and she waited for her for so long that no amount of money can take that away from her. As Khloe once said that having True in her life was such a dream.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Kris Jenner and Khloe Kardashian Building Side-By-Side $20 Million Mansions</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SCMP</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Life and Style Magazine</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8inqqKclWLBqbGMpZivoaOdeq21xZ5kqJ5dqb%2B2sYytn6iloKi8r3nDmqygoKSav267xWaioaSfmnqsrdGdmKygmZa7cA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./enver-gjokaj.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Introducing Enver Gjokaj - Biography &amp;amp; Net Worth">&larr;
