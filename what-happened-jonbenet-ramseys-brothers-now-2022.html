Sadly, however, there also is no denying that so many crimes are committed daily that most of them fly completely under the radar. However, every so often a crime is committed that grabs headlines all over the world.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>8 Celebs Who Adore True Crime</a></span>After leading a cult that took people’s lives, Charles Manson captivated the world to the point that people <a href=#>still talk about his music</a> to this day. During the mid-‘90s, so much attention was paid to OJ Simpson standing trial that people <a href=#>still troll the former football player</a> years after the fact. After what happened to her daughter Caylee, people are still blown away by Casey Anthony’s behavior, trial, and <a href=#>what she is up to now</a>.Another example of a crime that people have spoken about for years is what tragically happened to JonBenet Ramsey. Now that it has been many years since JonBenet’s story first hit the news, some people have been left wondering what has happened to her brothers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-jonbenet-ramsey-rsquo-s-brother-burke-up-to-now>What Is JonBenet Ramsey’s Brother Burke Up To Now?</h2><p>When Burke Ramsey was only 9 years old, he suffered a tragedy that nobody should ever have to go through at any age when his little sister JonBenet’s life was cruelly taken from her. As awful as it was for Burke to lose his sister, it is very clear that the media circus that followed only made things worse for JonBenet’s family.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This A-List Musician Is Wrapped Up In A Bizarre JonBenet Ramsey Conspiracy</a></span></p><p>Given how much the media focused on what happened to JonBenet Ramsey, it didn’t take long for people who were following the case to come up with their own theories. For example, the number one theory that a lot of people believed for a long time was JonBenet’s parents were responsible.</p><p>Amazingly enough, another oddly specific theory claimed that JonBenet took a piece of pineapple Burke Ramsey was eating and he lost his temper and did something that resulted in her passing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2008, Boulder County District Attorney <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mary Lacy apologized to the family of JonBenet Ramsey</a> for contributing “in any way to the public perception that you might have been involved in this crime”. The reason the apology came at that time is that DNA tests were performed that ruled out members of JonBenet’s family being involved in what happened to her.</p><p>Despite what the DNA tests revealed, in 2016 CBS aired a special in which forensic pathologist Werner Spitz accused Burke Ramsey of taking his younger sister’s life. In response, Burke sued Spitz and then filed a separate lawsuit against CBS for $750 million. In January of 2019, Burke and CBS settled the lawsuit “to the satisfaction of all parties”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from being forced to file lawsuits, Burke Ramsey has been busy trying to build a life for himself out of the spotlight. After earning a degree from Purdue University, Burke reportedly started a career as a software engineer. Sadly, Burke’s mother Patsy lost her life in 2006 after battling ovarian cancer. However, according to reports, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Burke has a “good relationship with his father”</a>.</p><h2 id=what-is-jonbenet-ramsey-rsquo-s-brother-john-andrew-ramsey-up-to-now>What Is JonBenet Ramsey’s Brother John Andrew Ramsey Up To Now?</h2><p>When JonBenet Ramsey disappeared, three members of her family were thrust into the spotlight, her father John, her sister Patsy, and her brother Burke. At that time, a lot of people had no idea that JonBenet actually had three half-siblings on her father’s side, Elizabeth, Melinda, and John.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Confessed Murderer of JonBenet Ramsey is Up For Parole In 2020. Will He Be Released?</a></span></p><p>Considering the whirlwind that JonBenet’s parents and Burke were put through, her half-siblings probably were relieved to not be in that situation on some level. However, it should go without saying that John and his sisters must have been deeply affected by losing their innocent little sister in such a ghastly way.</p><p>For anyone who looking for proof of what losing his little sister did to John Andrew Ramsey, consider this, nobody talks about what he does for a living or his personal life. As a result, nothing is known about those aspects of John’s life. Instead, there is one thing that is known about what has happened to John over the years, he is still trying to find the person who took his sister’s life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the years since JonBenet Ramsey’s passing, nobody has been charged with taking her life, and her much older half-brother John isn’t willing to accept that. After all, based on the years of time and effort John has put in, it seems like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his life is largely focused on finding justice for his little sister JonBenet</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZ%2B8r67Ep5ytZaKWurSx2Kxkm6qfqbWmvtJmpaivXWd9c36O</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-austin-butler-singing-in-elvis-inside-the-actors-prep.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Austin Butler Singing in Elvis?
