And when Kylie Jenner's spin-off,&nbsp;Life of Kylie, aired for one season in the summer of 2017, fans were introduced to her best friend forever, Jordyn Woods.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The pair seemed to do everything together and if two people were inseparable, it would be them. But then, in February 2019, news came out that was damaging to Khloe Kardashian's relationship with the father of her baby: Jordyn Woods and Tristan Thompson had reportedly been together.</p><p>Khloe was devastated, along with the rest of the Kardashian and Jenner clan, and fans have been following the drama super closely ever since. Here are the 20 worst things that the Kardashians ever did to Jordyn Woods.</p><h2 id=khloe-insulted-her-on-kuwtk><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Khloe Insulted Her On 'KUWTK'</span></h2><p>According to&nbsp;Teen Vogue, Khloe Kardashian didn't say the nicest things about Jordyn Woods in an episode of&nbsp;Keeping Up with the Kardashians. She insulted her appearance, which is never cool.</p><p>This definitely counts as one of the worst things that the famous family has done to Kylie's former BFF.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kylie-stopped-following-jordyn-on-social-media-which-is-embarrassing><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Kylie Stopped Following Jordyn On Social Media, Which Is Embarrassing</span></h2><p>You know you're friends with someone (or at least want to let them into your social circle) when you start following them on social media. And the same thing is true when you make the decision to stop.</p><p>A&nbsp;Metro.co.uk&nbsp;article from July 2019 says that Kylie stopped following Jordyn on social media. Since they're both celebs, this is pretty embarrassing and everyone found out about it.</p><h2 id=kim-said-kylie-is-responsible-for-jordyn-s-good-luxurious-life><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Kim Said Kylie Is Responsible For Jordyn's Good, Luxurious Life</span></h2><p>Stylecaster&nbsp;wrote that Kim Kardashian said that Kylie has done so much for Jordyn that she's essentially the reason why Jordyn has lived a nice life.</p><p>This is actually not true as&nbsp;Jordyn has been privileged forever, which is something that many people have been pointing out. This has been a big development in the feud.</p><h2 id=jordyn-started-talking-about-her-clothing-line-around-the-same-time-as-the-finale-of-kuwtk><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Jordyn Started Talking About Her Clothing Line Around The Same Time As The Finale Of 'KUWTK'</span></h2><p>The finale episode of&nbsp;KUWTK&nbsp;totally focused on Jordyn Woods and how the Kardashian family has felt about what's been going down.</p><p>Buzzfeed&nbsp;says that Jordyn Woods told everyone that she was doing a clothing line right around the time of this episode. This is definitely not a coincidence and it's interesting that these two things seem to be connected.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=khloe-accused-jordyn-of-milking-it-for-the-media><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Khloe Accused Jordyn Of Milking It For The Media</span></h2><p>According to&nbsp;In Style, Khloe Kardashian thinks that Jordyn Woods has totally been talking about this scandal to the media in order to get more fame and fortune out of it. Khloe has been quoted as saying, “Like my world got destroyed, while Jordyn is doing press interviews about it? Who the f— do you think you are?"</p><p>That's not that nice, either...</p><h2 id=jordyn-s-other-friends-took-the-kardashians-side><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Jordyn's Other Friends Took The Kardashians' Side</span></h2><p>Dailystar.co.uk has reported that Jordyn Woods has much fewer friends than before, thanks to the way that the Kardashian family has been treating her after this scandal went down.</p><p>It seems like perhaps her pals took the side of the Kardashian clan, which is too bad for Jordyn since you need friends at a time like this.</p><h2 id=kylie-phoned-jordyn-and-said-she-s-afraid-of-her><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Kylie Phoned Jordyn And Said She's Afraid Of Her</span></h2><p>According to the&nbsp;Huffington Post, Kylie Jenner has actually said that she's afraid of Jordyn. She said, “And I was just telling her, ‘I’m like scared of you now. Like, you’re capable of waking up the next morning with a smile on your face.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's not that nice to say that about someone who used to be such a good pal, right?</p><h2 id=kylie-basically-ignored-jordyn-right-after><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Kylie Basically Ignored Jordyn Right After</span></h2><p>After all of the drama happened, Kylie Jenner&nbsp;kept saying she didn't want to get involved, which seems so mean.</p><p>It seems like Kylie has chosen her family over her BFF. Sure, that must have been tough for her, but it's another example of how the Kardashians have treated Jordyn Woods badly.</p><h2 id=kim-and-kourtney-made-a-list-of-break-up-songs-and-sang-it><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Kim And Kourtney Made A List Of 'Break-Up Songs' And Sang It</span></h2><p>Refinery 29&nbsp;reported that in the season 16 finale episode of&nbsp;KUWTK, Kim and Kourtney sang a bunch of songs that they considered a "break-up playlist."</p><p>Even Kylie Jenner said this was mean because they were laughing and having so much fun with it. It doesn't really look that good since it's a serious situation.</p><h2 id=khloe-says-jordyn-won-t-apologize-making-jordyn-look-super-bad><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Khloe Says Jordyn Won't Apologize, Making Jordyn Look Super Bad</span></h2><p>According to the&nbsp;Huffington Post, Khloe keeps saying that Jordyn isn't interested in apologizing. That's not the best look...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When you mess up, you have to say that you're sorry to the person that you hurt. That's just something that we've all agreed on in our society. It totally applies to famous people, too.</p><h2 id=the-kardashian-jenners-will-never-work-with-jordyn-again><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>The Kardashian-Jenners Will Never Work With Jordyn Again</span></h2><p>Allure&nbsp;reported that the Kardashian-Jenner clan isn't going to work with Jordyn Woods again. This is another mean thing that the very famous family has done to Kylie's once-upon-a-time best friend.</p><p>While it's one thing to want to stop talking to someone, it's totally another when you're all in the public eye. They're not only treating Jordyn badly but they're doing so in the spotlight.</p><h2 id=khloe-tweeted-and-called-jordyn-a-liar><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Khloe Tweeted And Called Jordyn A Liar</span></h2><p>Heavy.com&nbsp;says that Khloe Kardashian tweeted,&nbsp;“Why are you lying @jordynwoods ?? If you’re going to try and save yourself by going public, INSTEAD OF CALLING ME PRIVATELY TO APOLOGIZE FIRST, at least be HONEST about your story. BTW, You ARE the reason my family broke up!”</p><p>Yikes... That's a pretty rough tweet.</p><h2 id=kylie-had-jordyn-move-out-then-come-get-her-stuff><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Kylie Had Jordyn Move Out, Then Come Get Her Stuff</span></h2><p>Friendship breakups are just as tough and it really seems like in this case, Kylie and Jordyn were so close that they're both struggling now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They even lived together, and as&nbsp;Elle.com&nbsp;reported, Kylie had Jordyn move out. And then, it gets even worse: the reality star wanted her former best friend to get her stuff. That's always the sign that things are really finished.</p><h2 id=khloe-has-said-she-s-done-with-her><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Khloe Has Said She's Done With Her</span></h2><p>According to&nbsp;People, Khloe "never wants to see Jordyn again." While it makes sense that she would feel this way after such a sad thing happened to her and her family, it's also a very harsh, intense thing to say publicly. And we wonder if that's really true? If she and Kylie patch their friendship up, what will Khloe say?</p><h2 id=the-kardashians-keep-throwing-her-under-the-bus-on-their-show><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The Kardashians Keep Throwing Her Under The Bus On Their Show</span></h2><p>When it comes to the way that the Kardashian family has treated Jordyn Woods, it seems fair to say that they really don't stop including her in their conversations. They keep talking about her, especially on their reality show.</p><p>This seems pretty unfair. They won't let it be a private, personal matter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=khloe-said-jordyn-s-side-of-the-story-is-totally-wrong><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Khloe Said Jordyn's Side Of The Story Is Totally Wrong</span></h2><p>It's no big surprise that with such a famous, dramatic feud, Khloe Kardashian would say that Jordan's lying and nothing she says is true.</p><p>There two sides to every story. Jordyn said it was just a kiss with "no passion" and Khloe has said she saw texts and it was a lot more than that. We'll never know... and it's definitely confusing.</p><h2 id=kylie-said-it-needed-to-happen><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Kylie Said It 'Needed To Happen'</span></h2><p>ET Online&nbsp;has quoted Kylie as saying,&nbsp;“I feel like this whole situation needed to happen for a reason for me, for her, for you, for everybody."</p><p>Since the family keeps acting like Jordyn is just the worst person ever, which has been pretty embarrassing for the model, it doesn't help the situation that Kylie believes it was something that "needed to happen."</p><h2 id=and-kylie-called-jordyn-her-security-blanket><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>And Kylie Called Jordyn Her 'Security Blanket'</span></h2><p>Although Kylie Jenner has stated that she would really rather not get involved in all of this drama, she's also said some less than great things about Jordyn Woods. It's kind of like the old saying: if you don't have anything nice to say, you shouldn't say anything at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kylie has said that Jordyn was her "security blanket." Why would she say that? That's not what being best friends is all about.</p><h2 id=kylie-is-being-super-passive-aggressive-about-it><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Kylie Is Being Super Passive Aggressive About It</span></h2><p>Kylie Jenner is "sending positivity" to Jordyn, according to&nbsp;Cosmopolitan, and we have to say one thing about that: it's super passive-aggressive.</p><p>This just isn't what you say about someone who you were so close with that you shared so many aspects of your life with them. It's like she's talking about a total and complete stranger.</p><h2 id=tristan-bought-khloe-a-pink-diamond-ring-which-seems-strange><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Tristan Bought Khloe A Pink Diamond Ring, Which Seems Strange</span></h2><p>The latest news in the feud is that Tristan purchased a pink diamond ring for Khloe. Ummm... what?!</p><p>If Khloe is so upset with Jordyn still, why accept it? This doesn't really add up or make any sense, and we're going to keep searching for all the news about this drama that we can.</p><p>Sources: Teenvogue.com, Metro.co.uk, Stylecaster.com, People.com, Elle.com, Refinery29.com, Etonline.com, Cosmopolitan.com, Huffingtonpost.com, Heavy.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhpaWWnpL%2B0wIytn6Kml6h6tbTEZqKaqpSWwKm1wKeqZp2mmr9usMidZK2nXZ%2B8s7DYp2Swp5%2BZwHA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dana-carvey.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dana Carvey Height, Weight, Age, Spouse, Children, Biography">&larr;
