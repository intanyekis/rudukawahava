As a result, it can be surprising to learn <a href=#>Hugh Grant regrets how he passed Two and a Half Men</a> or that <a href=#>Jennifer Grey wishes her relationship with Patrick Swayze was different</a>.</p><p>Even with that in mind, it still seems like everyone involved with The Lost Boys would be overjoyed to go down in history. After all, stars like <a href=#>Corey Haim who passed away after suffering from health issues</a> will always be remembered for The Lost Boys. Amazingly enough, however, there is reason to think that Alex Winter may have once regretted his role starring in The Lost Boys.</p><h2 id=why-filming-the-lost-boys-freaked-alex-winter-out>Why Filming The Lost Boys Freaked Alex Winter Out</h2><p>Before Alex Winter was hired to star in The Lost Boys, he had very limited experience acting on camera. In fact, Winter's biggest screen achievement before that was portraying an easy-to-forget supporting character in Death Wish 3.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/the-lost-boys-cast-promotional-photoshoot.jpg><p>To go from only being a background character to having a starring role would be a major transition for any actor. In Winter's case, however, that transition was made a lot bumpier because his big break came from starring in The Lost Boys.</p><p>In 2021, Winter spoke to CinemaBlend about the experience of starring in The Lost Boys. As Winter explained, starring in The Lost Boys was a lot of fun. However, the actor told the publication that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">filming The Lost Boys was so chaotic that it freaked Winter out</a>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/your-paragraph-text-2023-08-27t112613-420.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Does David Letterman Regret The Inappropriate Interviews He Conducted Over The Years?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>David Letterman had more than a few unpopular interviews when hosting his late-night show, and people wonder what he really thinks about them.</span><p>"I wish I had a camera while we were shooting Lost Boys, because that entire shoot was absolutely insane, and wild, and fun, and very specific to its era. … My first day on set, I got to Santa Cruz the day they were shooting the beach party scene."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Winter continued, "There’s Tim Cappello, the sax guy, all oiled up, right?

According to Winter, it was very difficult to see director Joel Schumacher's vision for the film based on the script alone.</p><p>"We really didn’t know what Joel had in mind, it was really hard to tell from the script. It seemed cool, he was really smart, and he was inspiring. You put your trust in him, and you felt he had a control of the vision. But even making the film, none of us exactly knew what the tone was, because there was so much to the film, and it could really have gone in any direction."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>The Lost Boys</p></td><td><p>1987</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Production Budget:$8,500,000</p></td><td><p>Worldwide Box Office: $32,394,143</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Given Winter's inexperience at that time, it is easy to understand how filming The Lost Boys could have been confusing and scary.

Fortunately enough, however, Winter explained to CinemaBlend that his experience filming The Lost Boys makes him <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">even more amazed by the film than fans</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I remember seeing the film finally done, when we all went to the cast and crew [screening,] I think it was at Warner Bros.

During that conversation, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Winter reflected on The Lost Boys' homoerotic undercurrent</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I do think that, for sure, our characters had that kind of undercurrent. I don't think it required, you know, sitting around a table read discussing it. I had spent my previous five years doing two long-running Broadway shows back to back — during the beginning of the AIDS crisis and at the height of the disco era. I started going to discos at, like, 13, 14, years old."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/did-alex-winter-regret-starring-in-the-lost-boys_.jpg><p>Winter continued, "I've been around the nightlife in New York a really long time. I came from a family of modern dancers, so I've been around trans and gender-fluid and gay people my whole life and it was really freaking obvious what he was up to and, and I thought it was great…that was what I took for Marko, I sort of pulled from these kids that I knew from Times Square, all of whom were totally gender-fluid."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-alex-winter>What Happened To Alex Winter?</h2><p>After starring in The Lost Boys put Alex Winter on the map to a certain degree, he went on to land the role of a lifetime.
