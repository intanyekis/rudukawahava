He experienced a challenging upbringing, growing up in poverty as one of ten siblings. Gotti’s parents, of Italian descent, struggled to make ends meet, with his father working as a day laborer.</p><p>From an early age, Gotti was drawn into a life of organized crime. He dropped out of school and joined the Fulton-Rockaway Boys, a gang associated with the mafia. This marked the beginning of his association with the criminal underworld.</p><p>Gotti’s rise through the ranks of organized crime was swift. He became involved with the powerful <b>Gambino crime family</b>, where he would eventually become one of the most notorious mob bosses in history. His early life experiences and upbringing played a crucial role in shaping his path towards a life of crime.</p><h3>Involvement with the Fulton-Rockaway Boys</h3><p>Gotti’s affiliation with the Fulton-Rockaway Boys exposed him to the world of organized crime at a young age. This gang, linked to the mafia, engaged in illicit activities such as theft and extortion. It was during this time that Gotti’s criminal ambitions started to take shape.</p><h3>Rise in the Gambino Crime Family</h3><p>Through his connections in the Fulton-Rockaway Boys, Gotti became involved with the Gambino crime family, one of the most powerful and influential organized crime groups in New York City. He quickly climbed the ranks and gained a reputation for his ruthless tactics and ability to evade law enforcement.</p><p>“I never lie because I don’t fear anyone. You only lie when you’re afraid.” – John Gotti</p><p>Gotti’s early life experiences, fraught with hardship and exposure to criminal activities, set the stage for his eventual rise to power as a feared and influential mob boss. His journey from the impoverished streets of the Bronx to becoming the head of the Gambino crime family is a testament to his calculated determination and ambition.</p><h2>John Gotti’s Criminal Career</h2><p>John Gotti’s criminal career began with small-scale crimes and truck hijackings. His cunning and loyalty earned him the trust of the mob, leading to his appointment as a captain in the notorious Gambino crime family. Gotti was a ruthless mob boss known for his ability to elude federal charges, earning him the infamous nickname “Teflon Don.”</p><p>In 1985, Gotti orchestrated the murder of the incumbent Gambino boss and seized control of the criminal empire. Under his leadership, the Gambino family amassed millions of dollars annually through illicit ventures such as loan sharking, construction schemes, gambling operations, and hijackings.</p><p>“I never lie because I don’t fear anyone.

His criminal activities were vast and lucrative, allowing him to amass considerable power and wealth within the underworld.</p><h3>The Criminal Empire</h3><p>Under Gotti’s reign, the Gambino family’s operations extended far and wide, raking in substantial profits. Some of the key ventures that contributed to Gotti’s criminal empire are:</p><table><tr><th>Activities</th><th>Profitability</th></tr><tr><td>Loan sharking</td><td>Highly profitable due to exorbitant interest rates and the lingering fear of reprisal</td></tr><tr><td>Construction schemes</td><td>Profitable through extortion, bid rigging, and labor racketeering</td></tr><tr><td>Gambling</td><td>Lucrative, fueled by illegal sports betting operations and illicit casinos</td></tr><tr><td>Hijackings</td><td>Profits generated from theft and resale of hijacked goods</td></tr></table><p>However, Gotti’s reign as the head of the Gambino family came to an end when he was finally convicted in 1992.

In 1958, he married Victoria DiGiorgio, and together they had five children.</p><p>Some of their children went on to achieve fame in the world of reality television. Notable examples include their daughter, Victoria Gotti, who starred in the show “Mob Wives,” and their daughter-in-law, Drita D’Avanzo, who appeared on “The Real Housewives of New Jersey.”</p><p>“My father was a man of strong convictions and protected his family fiercely. He had a softer side that not many people got to see. He was a loving and devoted husband and father,”</p><p>Unfortunately, John Gotti’s personal life took a tragic turn when he passed away. On June 10, 2002, while serving a life sentence in prison, Gotti succumbed to complications from throat cancer. He was incarcerated at the US Penitentiary in Marion, Illinois, at the time of his death.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/john-gotti-death-1024x585.jpg alt="john gotti death" title="john gotti death" width=1024 height=585 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>The Gambino Family’s Net Worth Comparison</h3><table><tr><th>Gotti Family</th><th>Gambino Family</th></tr><tr><td>Estimated Net Worth: Unknown</td><td>Estimated Net Worth: $500 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Level of Influence: Diminished</td><td>Level of Influence: Varied</td></tr></table><p>Although the specific financial details of the Gotti family’s current status remain undisclosed, it is evident that their fortune has dwindled in comparison to the past.

However, it is important to note that organized crime still exists to some extent and continues to adapt to new challenges and opportunities.</p><p>The Gambino crime family’s history is intertwined with the fabric of American organized crime. From its origins in the early 20th century to the reign of John Gotti, the family has left an indelible mark on the criminal underworld.
