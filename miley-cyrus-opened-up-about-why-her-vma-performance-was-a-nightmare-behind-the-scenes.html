When <a href=#><strong>Madonna</strong></a> dove to the ground in a wedding dress while performing "Like a Virgin," the audience couldn't believe what they were seeing. When Britney Spears tore off her suit and performed "Oops!...I Did It Again," parents said she was a bad role model for children.</p><p>This is a history <strong><a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a></strong> is well aware of and was determined to be part of when she performed at the VMAs in 2013. However, it would also be the start of many controversial moments Cyrus would have on the show.</p><p>It all culminated in a 2020 performance, which Cyrus said was a nightmare to prepare for. During a later interview, Cyrus even said a director for the show made a sexist comment to her behind the scenes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=miley-told-joe-rogan-that-a-director-at-the-vmas-made-a-sexist-comment-to-her-behind-the-scenes>Miley Told Joe Rogan That A Director At The VMAs Made A Sexist Comment To Her Behind The Scenes</h2><p>During the 2020 MTV Video Music Awards, Miley Cyrus was one of many performers who wowed the crowd at the show. However, as she would reveal on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, it wasn't exactly smooth sailing behind the scenes.</p><p>"I was just asking some questions, not even on some diva s***," Cyrus said. "I wanted the lights to be turned off and then the lighting of the room to just be lighting me. So no key light, no beauty light. The beauty light is always used on women and I said turn the f****** lights off. You would never tell Travis Scott or Adam Levine that he couldn’t turn the beauty light off."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"They said, ‘Okay, we’ll just do the same thing that we would do with the guys,’ because that’s what I want," she continued. "And then something that I was doing … for the VMAs, my bracelets kept getting caught in all this s*** and they said, ‘You want to be treated like a guy?

Many believed this to be a reference to her "Wrecking Ball" video. This is the moment during her performance Cyrus was seemingly referring to.</p><p>"And I said, ‘Well, a guy wouldn’t be doing this because a guy doesn’t sell your show with sex the way that I’m going to,'" she said.

In 2013, she shocked viewers with her performance of "We Can't Stop" and "Blurred Lines" with Robin Thicke. During the performance, Cyrus danced suggestively with Thicke and even sported a giant foam finger.</p><p>Many were shocked that this was the same girl who once played Hannah Montana on Disney Channel.</p><p>Shortly after the event, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyrus spoke with MTV News about the performance and the controversy that followed</a>.</p><p>"Me and Robin [Thicke,] the whole time said, 'You know we're about to make history right now,'" Cyrus said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/instar45935323.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time, Cyrus said that she felt people who reacted negatively to the performance were overthinking it.</p><p>"What's amazing is I think now, we're three days later and people are still talking about it.

Taylor Swift reacted to this as a personal attack on her own social media and was widely considered to be tone-deaf, since Minaj was making a greater point about the media neglecting contributions from Black female artists.</p><p>Swift later apologized to Minaj and admitted she was wrong. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyrus reacted to the situation in an interview with The New York Times</a> and said she didn't believe Swift was wrong. In fact, she claimed Minaj wasn't a nice person.</p><p>"And it’s not anger like, 'Guys, I’m frustrated about some things that are a bigger issue,'" Cyrus said. "You [Nicki Minaj] made it about you.
