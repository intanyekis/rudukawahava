They have all embarked on their own careers and begun to have some success of their own. So, which of Arnold Schwarzenegger's children currently has the highest net worth?</p><h2 id=arnold-himself-has-a-massive-net-worth><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Arnold Himself Has A Massive Net Worth</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Arnold Schwarzenegger has had a very succesful career in several industries. He began as a bodybuilder, and he is perhaps the most famous bodybuilder of all-time. He then transitioned into a very succesful film career, doing both comedy movies and action flicks. He also served as the Governor of California from 2003 until 2011. All of his career success has lead to a vast fortune that he may someday pass on to his children. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Celebrity Net Worth, Arnold Schwarzenegger is worth a reported $400 million</a>.</p><h2 id=joseph-baena-net-worth-unknown><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Joseph Baena (Net Worth Unknown)</span></h2><p>Arnold's youngest son, Joseph Baena, seems to be a relatively typical young man. In fact, his identity as the famous actor's son was not even revealed until Jopseph was around thirteen years old. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Arnold himself did not even know he was Joseph's father until Joseph was eight</a>. Joseph Baena has embraced the spotlight that came from being Schwarzenegger's son, but he has not started a career in the entertainment industry like some of Arnold Schwarzenegger's other children (or Arnold himself!) Therefore, Baena's net worth remains a mystery. Nevertheless, it's safe to say that he enjoys a wealthy lifestyle as Arnold Schwarzenegger's youngest son, and someday he is set to inherit quite the fortune.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>A Look At Arnold Schwarzenegger And Maria Shriver's Relationship Today</a></span></p><h2 id=christopher-schwarzenegger-net-worth-unknown><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Christopher Schwarzenegger (Net Worth Unknown)</span></h2><p>Christopher is Arnold's second-youngest son, and he's just a few days older than Joseph Baena. Christopher seems to enjoy a more private life than his siblings, and he has not pursued a career in the entertainment industry – at least not yet (he's still only 23 years old). According to a recent Instagram post that Arnold made for Christopher's birthday, the young Schwarzenegger clearly enjoys keeping fit. He takes boxing classes, weightlifting classes, stretching classes, and cycling classes. In other words, Christopher seems to be taking after his famously fit father. As for his net worth, the situation is pretty similar to that of his younger brother Joseph. Christopher certainly will not ever be in need of money, but his net worth is not publicly available information.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christina-schwarzenegger-net-worth-unknown><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Christina Schwarzenegger (Net Worth Unknown)</span></h2><p>Arnold Schwarzenegger's second-oldest child is a daughter named Christina, who just turned thirty this past year. While she isn't a huge celebrity like her father or some of her siblings, she did still get the family gene for the arts. According to Arnold's Instagram post on Christina's most recent birthday, she does work on "enlightening documentaries" and creates "fantastic artwork" that blows her father's "out of the water". According to her bio on Twitter, Christina is the executive producer of Take Your Pills, a documentary on Netflix. All in all, it seems like Christina has a lot of fascinating interests, but being in the public eye isn't one of them. She doesn't even have a public Instagram account, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her Twitter account is unverified and opnly has 15,000 or so followers</a>. That's quite different from her sister Katherina who clearly loves to be in the public eye and who is very popular and active on social media. Because Christina likes to keep her life private, her net worth isn't publicly available, but it probably isn't particularly high anyway. Eventually, however, she stands to inherit a portion of her parents' vast fortunes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Arnold Schwarzenegger At 72: This Is How He Eats And Trains</a></span></p><h2 id=katherine-schwarzenegger-3-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Katherine Schwarzenegger ($3 Million)</span></h2><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Arnold Schwarzenegger's eldest child, his daughter Katherine, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">is worth a reported $3 million</a>. However, she is now married to the movie star Chris Pratt, <a href=#>who has a $60 million net worth</a>. In other words, she is a lot wealthier than her $3 million net worth would have you think. Katherine Schwarzenegger is a published author. She has written a book for kids called Maverick and Me which tells the true story of how she adopted her beloved pet dog Maverick. She has also written several books for adults, including her latest book, which is a collection of true stories entitled The Gift of Forgiveness: Inspiring Stories from Those Who Have Overcome the Unforgivable. She has a daughter with her husband Chris Pratt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=patrick-schwarzenegger-6-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Patrick Schwarzenegger ($6 Million)</span></h2><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Arnold Schwarzenegger's middle child, his son Patrick, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">is worth a reported $6 million</a>. Patrick is an actor, and he's appeared in several films, including The Benchwarmers, Grown Ups 2, Midnight Sun,Echo Boomers and Moxie. His next film will be a science fiction drama called Warning, which comes out in 2022. He also appeared on an episode of the popular TV horror comedy Scream Queens. Patrick Schwarzenegger has also pulled in big bucks from several major modeling jobs. His most high-profile relationship was with Miley Cyrus, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who has a reported net worth of $160 million</a>. Patrick dated her for several months between 2014 and 2015. Currently, he is in a longterm relationship with a fellow model named Abby Champion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>These Photos Show How Much Arnold Schwarzenegger Has Changed Over The Years</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaGTnXqivs2oo51lo5i1uK3Rs5ynnZecsrN5wqGgpZyimrtutMign56rpGK7psCMsKarrJhivaLA0aKapGWblsGpsdGipZ5lnZa%2Fqq2MrJ%2Broaaav3A%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./hot-for-teacher-2015-remaster.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hot for Teacher (2015 Remaster) | Van Halen">&larr;
