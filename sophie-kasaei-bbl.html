Later, a litre of puss was removed from her bum cheek. Follow to know everything about her horrific experience in detail.</strong></p><p><strong>Sophie Kasaei</strong> is a 33-year-old English <strong><a href=#>television personality</a></strong> who has appeared on the MTV reality show, Geordie Shore from 2011 to 2013, and then again from 2016 to 2019. She also appeared on Celebrity Ex on the Beach in 2020.</p><p>Likely, Kasaei has appeared on the Geordie Shore spinoff, Geordie Shore OGs several times, and she also appeared on Just Tattoo of Us in 2017 alongside her then-boyfriend, <strong>Joel Corry</strong>. Furthermore, she joined the cast of the ITVBe reality show, The Only Way Is Essex, in 2023.</p><p>Recently, Sophie Kasaei has been in the spotlight for her stunning physique, especially her butt which seems bigger than before. Many people claimed she underwent a <strong>BBL</strong> to enhance her butt. So, if you are curious to know more about her transformation and wonder if she really received BBL, we're here to help.</p><p>You might also like to read the&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>plastic surgery</a></strong> stories of <a href=#><strong>Wendy</strong></a>&nbsp;and <a href=#><strong>John Stamos</strong></a>.</p><h2>Sophie Kasaei Openly Admits to Receiving a BBL (Brazilian Bum Lift)!</h2><p>According to <strong>Sophie Kasaei</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@sophiekasaei_</a>), the Geordie Shore star thought she was going to die after a terrifying encounter with a <strong>Brazilian Bum Lift</strong> (<strong>BBL</strong>) surgery. The TV star recently spoke with <strong>Chloe Burrows</strong> on her podcast, Chloe Vs The World, about the time she was given a BBL. However, things didn't work out for her, and she soon found herself in the hospital.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/11/sophie-kasaei-after-bbl.jpg alt="Sophie Kasaei's appearance after receiving a Brazilian Bum Lift (BBL). houseandwhips.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Sophie Kasaei's appearance after receiving a Brazilian Bum Lift (BBL).&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Instagram</strong></p><p>In the podcast, Sophie told Chloe about the initial procedure and how she was given a tablet that made her feel "f****d". She claimed to be out of it, but she had to get on the table naked. Later, she explained that when she went on vacation just weeks after the BBL, she believed that it would heal. However, things went horribly wrong while she was there, and she became unwell. She then <a href=# rel=noopener>stated</a>,</p><p><strong>I was feeling dizzy and faint, I started to get a really funny pain down my leg, it was numb and I thought, 'this isn't right'. I woke up one day and went to hospital. As soon as I got to the emergency room they started panicking around us. It was horrible. I was 23. They put loads of injections and tubes in and started taking my blood.</strong></p><p>Likely, Sophie Kasaei also explained that the doctors were having difficulty getting some blood out, so she had multiple needles in so they could get some. She was then taken in for an ultrasound, where doctors discovered an abscess in her lower cheek. She told Chloe:</p><p><strong>If that had burst and it got into my blood stream I would've been dead. It caused an infection. I thought, 'I'm gonna die in Mexico. I've got no family around us, and all for trying to look like Kim Kardashian.</strong></p><p>However, despite being in excruciating pain, Sophie Kasaei managed to get a flight home to Newcastle the next day. But she forced herself to return home because she was afraid she would die without her family. After arriving home, she was seen by a surgeon right away, and a litre of puss was removed from her bum cheek.</p><p>Later, Sophie went on to say, "When anyone says are BBLs worth it, I've had to get reconstruction through it, I've had to get so many things." Furthermore, the television personality added that she is now self-conscious about her bum and will avoid exposing it when she goes on vacation.</p><h2>Sophie Kasaei and Her Boyfriend, Jordan Brook, Sparked Secret Wedding Rumours With a Cryptic Post!</h2><p><strong>Sophie Kasaei</strong> and her boyfriend, <strong>Jordan Brook</strong>, who have been dating for about a year, never fail to compliment each other on Instagram.

She looked stunning as she modelled the swimsuit look in Majorca, showcasing her shorter hair. The reality star favourite <a href=# rel=noopener>penned</a>: “My short hair era,” to which Jordan replied: “My wife right f*****g there.” Fans loved Jordan's comment, but one person quickly commented, "She needs a ring on her finger."</p><p>The reality star couple made their relationship public in December, and they found their dream home in March.
