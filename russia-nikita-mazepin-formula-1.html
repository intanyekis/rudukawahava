We will help them psychologically to cope with the sense of loss and emptiness that comes from being excluded.</p><p>"We all know the career of an athletes is short and it requires years of sacrifice to compete. When that reward is taken away it is devastating, and no one is thinking what happens next. I will be addressing this.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Today I am announcing the creation of a new foundation to help athletes who have been blocked from competing for political reasons. <a href=#>#WeCompeteAsOne</a></p>— Nikita Mazepin (@nikita_mazepin) <a href=#>March 9, 2022</a><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Motorsport</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/03/GettyImages-1237170637.jpg><p>“Athletes unable to train due to upheaval will also be included in this. This will include athletes from all conflict zones and our door is open to everybody.</p><p>"We will beginning with the paralympic team in Russia which was banned from Beijing, having first been told they could travel. The name of the foundation will be ‘We Compete As One.’"</p><p>As part of the same press conference, Mazepin opened up on his departure from Formula 1, saying that he believes he should have had more support from his former team, Haas.</p><p>He said: "The reason I am speaking is to close my chapter with clarity and begin the next one with hope.</p><p>"I was informed last week in a letter from Haas’ lawyer of the immediate termination of my contract as a team driver. Prior to that the FIA, specifically the WMSC, ruled that I and other Russian drivers could compete under a neutral status.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/03/GettyImages-1238705004.jpg><p>"A similar provision has been enacted regarding for Daniil Medvedev in ATP (pro tennis), and he has been allowed to continue under a neutral status.</p><p>“I have consented through this ruling unconditionally when it was prepared by the WMSC, so the decision from Haas was not based either on any directive from the sport governing body or dictated by any sanctions that were placed against either me, or my father or his company, and of course I do not feel this is fair.</p><p>“In regards to the support from the team, I do feel like I should have had more. There has been no legal reason that could enable the team to terminate my contract, on legal terms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/03/GettyImages-1372316536.jpg><p>"I have explained that I have been very relieved to see that the FIA has allowed athletes to compete on a neutral status, and I was hoping — and to be honest the hope was feeling close — that I would be able to compete, but obviously 5th March at 11:45am Moscow time things really changed and I lost my dream that I was working towards for 18 years of my life.”</p><p>Formula 1 also&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ended its contract with the Russian Grand Prix</a>, while Motorsport UK announced&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Russian-licenced drivers will be banned from competing in the United Kingdom</a>&nbsp;and the British Grand Prix at Silverstone.</p><p>As a result, Haas are now looking for a new driver with Mazepin's replacement due to be named this week as attention turns to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Bahrain Grand Prix on Sunday, March 20.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaG4tLzOq6tnm5%2BifLS8zquraKWfqbyzv8%2Boqa1nYWWDcX6TcmarraOotqJ5zaKioqyRYrqixsSpoKdllqS%2FrsHLmmRqZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./blog.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Adam Dell Net Worth  How Much is Dell Worth?">&larr;
