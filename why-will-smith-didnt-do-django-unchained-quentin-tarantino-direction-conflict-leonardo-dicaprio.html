The film would go on to gross $426 million and earn his co-star Christoph Waltz his second Oscar.</p><p>Will Smith had previously explained that, “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It was about the creative direction of the story</a>." The movie tells the story of a freed slave who trains under a bounty hunter to rescue his wife from his former plantation owner (played by DiCaprio).</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Actually Saw Leonardo DiCaprio's Painful Hand Injury In 'Django Unchained'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He added that he was a fan of the script and wanted to make the movie "badly," he just couldn't quite see eye-to-eye with the director. “To me, it’s as perfect a story as you could ever want: a guy that learns how to kill to retrieve his wife that has been taken as a slave. That idea is perfect."</p><p>Smith wasn't happy with the fact that Dr. King Schultz (played by Waltz) had such an important role in the movie. "Django wasn’t the lead, so it was like, I need to be the lead. The other character was the lead!"</p><p>He also wanted <strong><a href=#>Quentin Tarantino </a></strong>to rewrite the ending, so he gets revenge on the plantation owner: "I was like, ‘No, Quentin, please, I need to kill the bad guy!"</p><p>Will Smith still has no regrets about turning down the role.

"This was one that was about love and the power of Black love. And that was something that I could rock with. We were going to make a story about how Black love makes us invincible.”</p><p>Directed by Antoine Fuqua, the 2022 historical drama follows runaway slave Peter (played by Smith) as he escapes from a Louisiana plantation in the 1860s. Smith admitted he felt the weight of the role during filming. “I went too far in Emancipation,” Smith revealed to Kevin Hart on his chat series Hart To Hart. “Just bringing it up, I start to get teary.
