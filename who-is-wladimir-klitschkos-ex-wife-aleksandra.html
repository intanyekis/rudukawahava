The many bouts fought by the 1996 Olympic gold medalist and World Heavyweight Boxer regularly drew massive television audiences of between 300 and 500 million viewers. Regarded as one of the best Heavyweight champions of all time, he was inducted into the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">International Boxing Hall of Fame Class of 2021.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition, the Ukrainian holds the record of being longest-reigning heavyweight boxing champion of all time. And there's more: Along with his brother Vitali, Wladimir has been included in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Guinness World Records as the champion who won the most boxing heavyweight world title fights</a> in history.</p><p>Recently, the charismatic ex-boxer has been back in the limelight with pleas for assistance for his homeland, Ukraine, as it faces invasion by Russia.</p><h2 id=the-boxer-with-a-phd>The Boxer With A PhD</h2><p>Wladimir is one of <a href=#>a handful of celebrities who has a Ph.D.</a> He often lectures in Sports science at the University of St Gallen, Switzerland. The sportsman who speaks four languages, recently enlisted in the Ukrainian reserve army alongside his brother Vitali, himself a Heavyweight World champ and Mayor of Kyiv since 2014.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although the siblings were made to promise their mother that they would never fight against each other, they have said they are prepared to fight side by side to protect their country.</p><h2 id=wladimir-39-s-relationship-with-hayden-panettiere-made-headlines>Wladimir's Relationship With Hayden Panettiere Made Headlines</h2><p>It’s not only in the fields of academics, boxing and war that the Ukrainian sports star has been in the limelight, however. Since 2009, the entertainment world has been fascinated by the tempestuous love story between the 6 foot 6 boxing champion and a diminutive Hollywood star. <a href=#>Hayden Panettiere and Wladimir Klitschko's relationship</a> has held the fans' interest for the last thirteen years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The glamorous couple met at a book launch more than a decade ago, and they dated for two years before breaking up. They rekindled their romance in 2013, and <a href=#>like some other high-profile couples, got engaged, but never tied the knot</a>.</p><p>They split up again five years later. In the meantime, the Heroes star and the world champion had a child together. Daughter Kaya was born in December 2014.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During their on-again-off-again relationship, images of the couple were flashed across screens and in magazines all over the world. That's understandable, considering that they're both high profile people.</p><p>Despite separating, the couple has remained on good terms for the sake of their daughter.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Does Hayden Panettiere Feel About Ex Wladimir Klitschko Going Back To Ukraine?</a></span></p><p>However, it seems that the ex-boxer might have had another glamorous relationship in his past life. Although there’s not much else written about Aleksandra Klitschko, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sources suggest she was married to the Ukrainian boxer</a> for two years.</p><p>Interestingly, though, the Facebook profile under her name features no posts, and the Instagram account has only one photo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wladimir-39-s-mysterious-ex-wife-is-apparently-also-a-famous-actress>Wladimir's Mysterious Ex-Wife Is Apparently Also A Famous Actress</h2><p>Wladimir's name is at the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">top of the list of Ukrainian celebrities</a> on The Famous People. It's a small wonder that fans would like more details about his private life.</p><p>Yet there’s no listing of the mysterious Aleksandra on Wikipedia’s 'Personal life' section about the famous ex-boxer. According to News Unzip, it would seem Wladimir's ex-wife is also a celebrity in their homeland of Ukraine.</p><p>Apparently famous as an actress and model, the site says she was married to Wladimir for two years between 1996 and 1998. The site also mentions that after the couple divorced, the enigmatic beauty reverted to her maiden surname and is now known as Aleksandra Avizova. Similarly, there's no information on her under that name, either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Further data on the site include mention of her birthday, 16th May 1975. Apparently Aleksandra has featured in commercials for a number of famous fashion brands and has appeared on TV shows and in films. Even her net worth is mentioned, estimated to be around $3 Million.</p><h2 id=little-kaya-may-have-a-brother>Little Kaya May Have A Brother</h2><p>Some other details on the site reveal that Aleksandra has a son, Michael Avizova. There is some speculation about whether Wladimir is the father though, as the boy carries his mother’s maiden surname.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Where Is Hayden Panettiere And Wladimir Klitschko's Daughter During The Ukraine Conflict?</a></span></p><p>If the details about Wladimir's ex-wife are discovered to be true, that would mean Kaya may have a sibling.</p><h2 id=aleksandra-hasn-rsquo-t-been-in-the-news>Aleksandra Hasn’t Been In The News</h2><p>Considering that she is a celebrity, its interesting that Aleksandra hasn’t taken any stand during the current strife in her homeland. However, Hayden Panettiere certainly has. On 6 December 2013, while she was still engaged to Wladimir, the pair addressed the crowds at the Euromaidan protests in Kyiv.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Nashville star also recently posted a lengthy caption on Instagram expressing her unwavering support for the country and joining other stars who are helping to raise funds for those affected by the conflict.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Money Did Mila Kunis Raise To Help Ukraine?</a></span></p><p>But whether Aleksandra even exists or not remains a mystery for now.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Amy Schumer Slammed For Insensitive Ukraine Joke</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuw8uam6Klmad6rLjIraqcoJukwG6x12auop6VYq6tscqsmKecopZ8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./all-you-need-to-know-about-camille-lamb.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="All You Need To Know About Camille Lamb">&larr;
