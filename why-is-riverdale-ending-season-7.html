After years of presenting DC Comics shows, the network delved into the world of Archie Comics when it launched the series Riverdale in 2017. The show follows the lives of Archie Andrews and his gang as they deal with school, romance, and everything in between as they also come to learn about Riverdale’s darkest mysteries.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>‘Riverdale’ Fans Furious After Cheryl Blossom’s Chaotic Performance Of Lady Gaga’s ‘Stupid Love’</a></span>Riverdale was just wrapping up its sixth season around the time that The CW confirmed that the show would only be back for one more season. And while the network has been supportive of the Archieverse, some may say that its decision to bring the series to an end makes sense.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-the-cw-cancel-riverdale>Why Did The CW Cancel Riverdale?</h2><p>It seems that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the network decided to cancel the series simply because it’s time</a>. “I am a big believer in attempting to give series that have had long runs an appropriate sendoff,” CW Chairman and CEO Mark Pedowitz said recently.</p><p>“We had a long conversation with [executive producer] Roberto [Aguirre-Sacasa] yesterday, who is thrilled by this news, and we will treat the show in the manner it deserves…. We want to make sure it goes out the right way.” He also added, “I think they, too, felt that seven years is the right amount. As a fan myself, I do want to do what is right for the show.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the same time, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aguirre-Sacasa also believed that their show would be ending soon</a>. “Honestly, I feel like... you know, we'll have had seven seasons. Truly, I think it was bittersweet,” he said. “I think we were all anticipating it, we thought that seven would be it.”</p><p>He also admitted that he didn’t expect a show like Riverdale to go on for as long as it had.</p><p>“When the call came, it definitely was bittersweet and there was a sadness. But, I don't think anyone ever imagined a show based on the Archie comic book characters, that was dark and twisted, would last nearly as long as it did, and resonate with an audience,” Aguirre-Sacasa explained. “So I feel good.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-does-the-cast-feel-about-riverdale-s-end>How Does The Cast Feel About Riverdale's End?</h2><p>As for the stars, there are also <a href=#>mixed feelings as they work on a whole season of Riverdale one last time</a>. “I do dread the day that we actually wrap because I know it’ll be an incredibly emotional experience,” Lili Reinhart, who stars on the show as Betty Cooper, said during a recent appearance on On Air with Ryan Seacrest. “I'll miss my family out there and I kind of like having my apartment in Vancouver. … It will be the wrapping of a big chapter in my life.”</p><p>That said, the actress has also said that she’s ready to move on and in fact, it looks like she’s started to, with the Netflix film Look Both Ways.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything Lilli Reinhart Has Done Since Her Split From 'Riverdale' Co-Star Cole Sprouse</a></span></p><p>Meanwhile, Cole Sprouse, who had onscreen and offscreen romance with Reinhart on the show, had also revealed that he and his castmates feel it’s time to “wrap it up with a bow.” The actor, who also recently starred opposite Lana Condor in Moonshot, has made it clear that he now wants to pursue other projects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I'm not a creative force behind [Riverdale]. I actually have no creative control,” Sprouse once told GQ. “We show up, receive the scripts often the day of, and we're asked to shoot.</p><p>At the same time, it’s also worth noting that <a href=#>the show’s ratings have been disappointing </a>as of late. When Riverdale resumed its Season 6 run recently, it only pulled in less than 250,000 according to reports. This is the show’s lowest rating yet.</p><h2 id=here-rsquo-s-what-rsquo-s-next-in-the-archieverse-after-riverdale>Here’s What’s Next In The Archieverse After Riverdale</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Riverdale may be coming to an end, but it seems Archieverse will be alive and well on The CW. Around the time that the show’s cancellation was announced, the network also revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a series entitled Jake Chang is currently in the works</a>. Jake Chang focuses on the daily life of an Asian-American 16-year-old private investigator living in Chinatown who also attends an elite private high school.</p><p>The show comes from writer Oanh Ly and writer-director Viet Nguyen who both worked on Netflix’s The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. Meanwhile, actor Daniel Dae Kim’s 3AD is also producing the series.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Are So Ready For 'Riverdale' To End After Season Seven (And So Is The Cast)</a></span></p><p>“We are so proud and honored to be a part of this new wave of Asian-American content created by and starring Asian-Americans,” Ly and Nguyen said in a statement. “The world of Jake Chang is vast, compelling, and a whole lot of fun. And just like our rascally teen detective, we’re going to lean into the ‘F U’ of the original ‘Fu Chang’ IP and delightfully destroy all familiar tropes and tell a unique Asian-American story.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So far, The CW hasn’t announced a premiere date yet Jake Chang.
