"That was special, I'll remember it for the rest of my life," Bennett said after the game in Los Angeles, adding, "Champions of the whole world," per the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>. "Just seeing everybody who was here when I got here, and they're still here and we're back-to-back, I just, I don't know," he said.

He also reportedly "did intentionally cause visible bodily harm [by] causing bruising to the right biceps and bruising and abrasion to her shins." He has also been charged with misdemeanor battery. He was freed later after posting a $1,850 bond.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Javon Bullard&nbsp;</h2><p>Star Bulldogs defensive back Javon Bullard was arrested on September 26, 2022, and charged with seven misdemeanors, including DUI.
