When you really look at it, that makes a lot of sense since spending your childhood in the spotlight is bound to take its toll on anyone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it is bad enough that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a lot of former child stars grow up to have a lot of legal problems</a>, the truth of the matter is that many of them are broke as adults too. In fact, there are far too many examples of former child stars taking their parents to court once they came of age and realized their guardians pilfered all of their money.</p><p>Seemingly able to avoid a lot of the trappings of early stardom, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angus T. Jones has changed a lot over the years</a> but he hasn’t been a tabloid mainstay. With that and the fact that Jones’ most famous job paid him a lot of money in mind, it begs an obvious question, how much money does he have today?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlie Sheen Used To Be Worth $150 Million, Here’s How Much He Has Left Today</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=career-beginnings>Career Beginnings</h2><p>Judging by the fact that lots of parents think that their kids are uniquely talented, it makes perfect sense that so many children wind up auditioning for film and TV roles. Of course, the vast majority of kids who attempt to make it as an actor at a young age don’t go on to attain any real measure of fame in their life.</p><p>Able to beat all of those odds, Angus T. Jones’ first movie, Simpatico, came out 3 years before the show that he is most famous for today debuted on television. After landing a small role in that mostly forgotten film, Jones appeared in his first major project when landed a role in a 2001 episode of ER. Continuing to find television work in the 2 years that followed, Jones also appeared in a pair of TV movies, Dinner with Friends and Audrey’s Run.</p><p>Amazingly enough, before Angus T. Jones landed the role that would turn him into a TV superstar, he put together an enviable movie career that must have made him a good amount of money. After all, in 2001, Jones was billed second from the top in the family film See Spot Run. Still not done with major movies, Jones then went on to land memorable roles in The Rookie and Bringing Down the House before landing another lead role in George of the Jungle 2.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Child Stars No One Will Recognize In 2019</a></span></p><h2 id=the-role-of-a-lifetime>The Role Of A Lifetime</h2><p>Whenever most people attain a great deal of success in their business of choice, it is perfectly reasonable to carry yourself with a certain level of confidence. For example, when Angus T. Jones auditioned to land one of Two and a Half Men’s lead roles he must have felt pretty good since he’d already attained a lot of success. Even still, it is simply amazing that Two and a Half Men’s creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chuck Lorre revealed that Angus was the only kid he let audition for the network since he thought Jones was the only person for the role</a>.</p><p>What Angus T. Jones and the other stars of Two and a Half Men never could’ve known when they joined the show’s cast was that it would become a television behemoth. One of the show’s main stars throughout the first 10 seasons, Jones’ time starring in Two and a Half Men turned him into a superstar but he never seemed to buy into all the hype. For further proof of that, look no further than the fact that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angus T. Jones mostly left Two and a Half Men after he decried its content in a controversial interview</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Things That Really Happened On The Set Of Two And A Half Men</a></span></p><h2 id=mega-money>Mega Money</h2><p>At the height of Angus T. Jones’ time starring in Two and a Half Men, he was paid the hefty sum of $350,000 for each of the episodes he appeared in. Considering that most of those seasons consisted of more than 20 episodes, it is clear that his base salary put loads of money in his bank account.</p><p>One thing that most people seem to forget about TV stardom is that it results in several streams of income. For example, if a show does well in syndication, a lot of the time its stars make a huge amount of money from it. Fortunately for Angus T. Jones' bottom dollar, reruns of Two and a Half Men seem to be on the air every hour of the day so clearly, syndication has been very rewarding for him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Angus T. Jones has expressed his willingness to act again in the future, it has been a long time since his main job has been showing up on set. For some actors that may be a huge problem but unless Jones makes some huge mistakes, he won’t need to stress about money for a very long time. After all, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebritynetworth.com reports that Angus T. Jones has a net worth of $20 million as of 2020</a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is How Much ‘Two And A Half Men’ Actor Jon Cryer Is Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0edOwpmaZnpl6onnHmqOfZZ2au26%2F05qpZpmenMK0edNmoaimlah6r7HTZq6oqqSderW7w5qwaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-dina-hashem-here-are-5-facts-you-need-to-know.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Dina Hashem?
