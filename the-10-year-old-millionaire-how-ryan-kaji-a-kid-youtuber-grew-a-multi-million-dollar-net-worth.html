Born in 2011, Kaji began his career in YouTube at the age of 3 with his parents.

He has received over<a href=#> 48 million views on YouTube</a>, with his most-watched video receiving 2 million views. His net worth has been estimated to be $26 million, and while a strong bulk of his income comes from the channel, the 10-year old has stepped into different endeavors to increase his fortune.</p><p>From stepping into the world of video games and television shows to becoming a published author, little Ryan Kaji has done it all. Let’s take a look at how a 10-year old Kid YouTuber amassed his massive multi-million-dollar net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=through-social-media-platforms>Through Social Media Platforms</h2><p>The Kajis have several channels on YouTube apart from Ryan’s World, although the main channel is the prime income source for the family.
