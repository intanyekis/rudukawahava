His family moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1999, where he spent most of his childhood and developed a taste for hip-hop music and rap. He grew up with his two brothers listening to artists like Kanye West, 50 Cent, Eminem, and Lil Wayne. He graduated from Vance High School in 2010, after which he started considering becoming a musician, as per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TSR</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Greatest Billboard Hits Of Nicki Minaj, Ranked</a></span></p><p>He attended the University Of Carolina for two years but then dropped out, stating he enrolled just for the sake of his parents, thus expressing his disinterest in studies. DaBaby started taking his music career seriously between 2014 and 2015 and <a href=#>released his debut mixtape </a><i>Nonfiction </i>in 2015, which created ripples around the hip-hop genre.</p><p>DaBaby followed his debut with a mixtape series called <i>God’s Work </i>which consisted of mixtapes like<i> Baby Talk, Billion Dollar Baby, </i>and<i> Back on My Baby Jesus Sh*t.</i> He assumed the stage name of Baby Jesus but soon dropped it as it was too outrageous. DaBaby was contacted by the well-known hip-hop label Interscope after four years. He accepted the label's offer of a deal and joined them. DaBaby made all essential preparations for his label launch in 2019 and named it <i>Billion Dollar Baby </i>after his hit mixtape. From that point on, his life began to change.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dababy-s-rise-to-fame>DaBaby’s Rise To Fame</h2><p>DaBaby was prepared to rule the world after releasing two successful full-length studio albums, several independently produced mixtapes, and his label. His career ascent began in 2019 with the publication of his debut album, <i>Baby on Baby</i>. Interscope Records left no stone unturned in the album's promotion and release. DaBaby’s debut album consisted of 13 distinct tracks, with each track having a guest artist in the form of some of the hottest hip-hop and R&B artists, including the likes of Stunna 4 Vegas, Rich the Kid, Rich Homie Quan, Offset, Etc.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><i>Baby on Baby</i> album was listed at number 25 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. <i>Suge</i>, his monster smash, peaked at the top of many lists, including the Billboard Hot 100 at number 87, where it later reached the top 10. The CEO of South Coast Music Group approached DaBaby for a deal which he accepted later, and now his career reached the absolute peak with a lucrative joint contract with two record giants.</p><p>Baby On Baby was a commercial success, and DaBaby became an overnight celebrity featured on the cover page of XXL’s <i>Freshman Class of 2019. </i>As per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, with his second album, <i>Kirk, </i>DaBaby reached new heights of success. <i>Kirk </i>was an even bigger hit than his debut album topping all the charts and making people groove. With just two albums, he had the most entries on the Billboard Hot 100 for 2019. The <i>Suge </i>rapper continued his collaboration with big-shot rap artists while embracing fame and money in every way possible</p><h2 id=dababy-s-greatest-hits>DaBaby’s Greatest Hits</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>DaBaby received two nominations for <i>Suge</i> at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in the categories of Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song in 2020, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Clture</a>. Following this, <i>Blame It on Baby</i>, his third studio album, was released on April 17, 2020. <a href=#>The album debuted at the top of the Billboard 200</a> with 124,000 album-equivalent units, marking his second number-one album.</p><p><i>Blame It On Baby</i> garnered mixed to good reviews and was a commercial success. It also was the cause for the inception of<i> Rockstar</i>, DaBaby’s highest-charting single with Roddy Ricch, which peaked at number one in the UK and spent seven odd weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart. While <i>Rockstar</i> was still trending in the Hot 100 chart in June, DaBaby featured on the Jack Harlow song <i>What's Poppin</i> remix, which reached number two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thus, DaBaby became the first artist to hold the top two spots on the chart since Ariana Grande in 2019. He appeared on the Pop Smoke and Lil Baby song <i>For the Night</i> in July, which debuted at number six on the Hot 100. DaBaby became the seventh artist to simultaneously chart at least three songs in the top six, having an absolute dream run of a career.
