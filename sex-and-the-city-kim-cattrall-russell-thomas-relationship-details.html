Despite her fame, the actress managed to keep her personal life away from the spotlight, and most fans didn't know she has been dating for years now! Although the actress sometimes shares pictures of the couple on social media, she hardly talks about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#>&nbsp;10 Of The Longest Married Couples In The Music Industry &nbsp;</a></span></p><p>Last month, she opened up about it for the first time. And it is great to see she found the perfect match and she is overwhelmed with joy. Here is everything we know about her relationship so far.</p><h2 id=they-met-in-london><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>They Met In London</span></h2><p>Kim Cattrall and Rusell Thomas met in London when he worked on BBC. It is unclear what was Rusell's position at the broadcaster, but they had a connection straight away, and they went to a few dates while the <a href=#>Sex and the City</a> star was in the city.</p><p>Cattrall didn't have high expectations since they lived in different countries. However, she was wrong, and the couple has been together for four years now. Sometimes having low expectations can result in great surprises.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-went-to-meet-the-actress-in-canada><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>He Went To Meet The Actress In Canada</span></h2><p>After some days, Kim Catrall went back to Canada. The couple kept in touch, and he decided to visit the actress in Vancouver. "We kind of liked each other, we kept in touch, and then he came out to Vancouver," <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cattrall said</a>. "It was very brave of him because we didn't really know each other other than having a few meals together. But he came, and we got along great, and we've been together ever since!"</p><p>Catrall didn't reveal how long Thomas stayed in Canada. But it was long enough for them to realize it was not just a fling.</p><h2 id=age-gap-has-never-been-a-problem><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Age Gap Has Never Been A Problem</span></h2><p>Kim Catrall made an Instagram post this year celebrating Rusell Thomas's 50th birthday. There is a 14-year gap between the couple, but Cattrall never cared about it. In 2010, journalists asked her if she saw a problem that her characters were often involved with younger men. She had the best answer. "No, not at all. He's so gorgeous and adorable. At a certain age, people merge, don't they?" <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp; <a href=#>10 Female Celebs Who Married Younger Men (& Their Age Gap)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Catrall also said that she doesn't think in those terms anymore. "Maybe I've lived longer and done more things, but I don't see a difference on stage. Some of the lines might have a different significance because of my age, but that adds richness," she added.</p><h2 id=they-went-official-on-instagram-in-2018><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>They Went Official On Instagram In 2018</span></h2><p>Kim Catrall is very low-profile when it comes to her personal life. She kept her relationship away from the spotlight, and just posted a picture of them two years after they started dating. In 2018, Catrall and Thomas spent her birthday together and she said:" Spending your B'Day with the one you love.....Thank you all for such a happy & delicious day."</p><p>It was the first time the couple made the headlines. But they are still discrete, and Catrall hardly talks about them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=it-is-the-first-time-katrall-introduces-a-boyfriend-since-2009><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>It Is The First Time Katrall Introduces A Boyfriend Since 2009</span></h2><p>Kim Cattrall is discrete, and she doesn't like to share information about her love life. Since she ended her relationship with Alan Wyse, in 2009, the fans have never seen the star with a new boyfriend on the red carpet or in other events. So if she decided to make it public is because it is a serious relationship.</p><p>Catrall was married three times. The first time she tied the knot with Mark Levinson, and then to Andreas J. Lyson and Mark Levinson.</p><h2 id=they-don-t-live-together-yet><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>They Don't Live Together Yet</span></h2><p>Kim Cattrall lives in the U.S., and Rusell Thomas is still living in London. The couple decided to have a long-distance relationship, and it seems to be working since they are together for four years now.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> Emmys 2020: 10 Best Red Carpet Looks (From Your Favorite Celebsâ€™ Instagram)</a></span></p><p>Of course, dating someone who lives overseas is not easy and demands planning. But Cattrall and Thomas seem to spend lots of time together, especially in Canada and they are managing it well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-spent-the-quarantine-in-vancouver><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>They Spent The Quarantine In Vancouver</span></h2><p>Kim Cattrall and Russell Thomas had to make a quick decision when the borders started to close in 2020. The couple decided to stay in Canada, and they have been together in the country since then. "From the beginning, [Russ] and I felt like we needed to get out of town, so we came up to my house in Canada," <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said</a>.</p><p>The actress still has a place in New York, but it seems that she would have more space in Vancouver. Her mother lives there, so she also wanted to be close in case something happened. Another good thing about their decision is that they are near nature. There is a lake in front of her house, and there are areas where she could walk near nature.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-catrall-described-the-relationship-as-easy><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Kim Catrall Described The Relationship As Easy</span></h2><p>The best thing that you can find in a relationship is the feeling of being 100% comfortable around each other. And Kim Cattrall has that with Thomas. In a rare interview where she talked about them, the actress said that everything was easy with him.</p><p>"I'm very comfortable around him,"<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> she revealed</a>. "He's a firecracker, and he's got a wicked sense of humor. And he's easy on the eyes!" It seems that our beloved star has found the one for her.</p><h2 id=children-are-not-part-of-the-plan><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Children Are Not Part Of The Plan</span></h2><p>The couple seems perfect together, and it seems they have no plans to add another family member. In the past, Kim Cattrall said that she chose not having children because of her insane routine while filming <a href=#>Sex and The City</a>. "It was the first momentâ€”it was extraordinaryâ€”in my life where I thought, Maybe I'm just not going to do this," she told <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glamour</a>.</p><p>The actress doesn't have a problem with that. "I thought, I have a place to be a mom here, not a biological mom but a mom and an auntie and a friend," she added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-checks-every-box><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>"He Checks Every Box"</span></h2><p>Kim Cattrall seems to be more in love than ever. In September, she told in an interview that Russell Thomas checks every box of what she is looking for. "What I love about us at this moment is we have a connectionâ€¦ There are elements of art and war, but in a very loving way, so yes, it checks every box I've ever had and then some, so we're real good," <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she detailed</a>.</p><p>It seems that we are going to see them together for a long time.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp; <a href=#>2020 Celebrity Weddings That Were Postponed Because Of Quarantine</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqnrBdlruledOhnGabmanGbrfIpmScmaSpv6K4y2aprqujmrmtedOhpqaZo2K%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF5w56rmqGcqHw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./hilary-duff.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hilary Duff Bio, Age, Married, Husband, Kids, Net Worth, Earnings">&larr;
