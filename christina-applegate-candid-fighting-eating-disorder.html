She spoke candidly about it in an episode of her and Jamie-Lynn Sigler's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"MeSsy" podcast</a>, saying "<strong>I just deprived myself of food for years and years and years," which she described as "torture.</strong>"</p><p>She was just 15 years old when she joined the Married... with Children cast, and she said that part of the reason she developed an eating disorder was her mother, who was unhealthily invested in her career and believed she needed to be extremely thin to be successful, so <strong>she put her on Weight Watchers to control her diet</strong>.</p><p>"She was always competitive," the actress said of her mother. "If I got down to 110 [pounds], she'd be like, 'How’d you do it?' And the reason was, I had an eating disorder."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Christina Applegate's struggle with anorexia got to the point where <strong>she would only eat "five almonds in a day" and "would cry and I wouldn’t want to leave the house," if she ended up eating one more</strong>.</p><p>The producers of the show eventually noticed her weight-loss had gotten out of control and became scared for her, especially because she "wanted [her] bones to be sticking out, so I didn’t eat." She said they eventually staged some kind of intervention. "<strong>It was very scary to everyone on set because they were like, 'Christina never eats.' They talked to me about it.</strong>"</p><h2 id=christina-applegate-39-s-battle-with-ms>Christina Applegate's Battle With MS</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/anthony-anderson-escorts-christina-applegate.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While her struggles with anorexia might be behind her, Christina Applegate is now facing another heartbreaking illness, and she's doing it incredibly gracefully.</p><p>In 2021, she shared with the world that she had been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, and <strong>despite having overcome an eating disorder and a cancer diagnosis, as well as several complex surgeries, she said this disease is <a href=#>the worst thing that ever happened to her</a></strong>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/your-paragraph-text-2024-03-19t095414-624.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Christina Applegate Was Visibly Bothered When Fans Didn't Laugh At Her MS Joke During Her Jimmy Kimmel Interview">Christina Applegate Was Visibly Bothered When Fans Didn't Laugh At Her MS Joke During Her Jimmy Kimmel Interview</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Jimmy Kimmel defended the audience after they kept quiet following Christina Applegate's MS joke.</p><p>Her and Jamie-Lynn Sigler's podcast, "MeSsy", is a coping mechanism for her.
