And tha’t snot just because of how difficult it can be traveling to each game given her schedule. Taylor is also worried about being a distraction, given the media attention her appearances bring.</p><p>“Taylor doesn’t want to be a distraction to Travis,” they revealed. “She knows it’s not easy when she shows up to his games. It’s a spectacle. She wants to support him and strike a balance while, at the same time, not be distracting to the team.”</p><p>While busy schedules and media attention may become an issue in the future, there’s no denying Taylor seems committed to making things work in the interim.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lp6S%2Fs7XEnWSbraOuerSvx56brqSVYrW2vtNmq6uZpp7AbrfEpZqeZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXq1vsCvnKWhnpx6onnLqKto</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./these-are-ansel-elgorts-10-highest-grossing-movies-ever.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="These Are Ansel Elgort's 10 Highest-Grossing Movies Ever">&larr;
