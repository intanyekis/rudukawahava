He is also a Heisman trophy contender.</p><p>After a season plagued with injury, Dillon is back in his peak form, performing again at an elite level. As he gets ready for the NFL draft, let us help you get familiar with one of our favorite football quarterbacks in college football.</p><p>In this article, we will explore Dillon Gabriel’s Ethnic background, nationality, faith, and family background. Let’s get into it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Dillon_Gabriels_Ethnicity_and_Nationality><strong>Dillon Gabriel’s Ethnicity and Nationality</strong></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sportzhive.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Dillon-Gabriel-Ethnic-Background.jpg><p>Dillion Gabriel is a Native Hawaiian American football player. His parents, Garrett and Dori, are both native Hawaiians, and he was born and raised in Mililani, Hawaii, which is a US state. Dillion is very proud of his Hawaiian heritage and said that it fuels him to do better.</p><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody><tr><td>Name</td><td>Dillon Kaipo Gabriel</td></tr><tr><td>Ethnicity</td><td>Native-Hawaiian</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Faith</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Languages</td><td>English, Hawaiian</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Garrett and Dori Gabriel</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Gabriel_Family_Background><strong>Gabriel Family Background</strong></span></h2><p>Dillon Gabriel comes from a very close-knit family with a strong athletic background. His father, Garrett, was a quarterback for the University of Hawaii in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and still holds some records that haven’t been touched.</p><p>Meanwhile, his mother, Dori, is a former college softball player. Dillon also has two brothers, the older brother, Garrison Gabriel, who was a Pop Warner football player, and a younger brother, Roman Gabriel, a potential athlete.</p><p>With such a strong family background and inclination towards sports, we shouldn’t be surprised by what Dillon has been able to achieve. His dad wasn’t just a parent but also his mentor who shaped him into the quarterback we see today.</p><p>In a post-game press conference, Dillon said- “I’ve got a lot of family back home that just loves me and is very supportive of my dreams and aspirations”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Dillon_Gabriels_Faith><strong>Dillon Gabriel’s Faith</strong></span></h2><p>Dillon Gabriel is a devout Christian and has spoken about his religion and its importance on several occasions in length. Gabriel has credited God for his success as a football player and has said that his faith keeps him grounded and focused on his goals.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Dillon_Gabriels_College_Career><strong>Dillon Gabriel’s College Career</strong></span></h2><p>Dillon went to Mililani High School in Mililani, Hawaii, and played for the school’s football team there, winning himself the 2018 Gatorade High School Football Player of the Year for Hawaii.</p><p>Gabriel began his college career at UCF in 2019, where he started all 12 games of the season as a freshman and led the Knights to a 10-3 record. He was named the American Athletic Conference Rookie of the Year and was also a second-team All-AAC selection.</p><p>However, due to a broken clavicle and some restrictions by the UNC made his move to the Oklahoma Sooners during the 2021 season. He was immediately named the starting quarterback for the Sooners and led the Oklahoma offense in the 2022 season, throwing for 3,168 yards and 25 touchdowns.</p><p>He is currently in his senior season at Oklahoma and is getting prepared for the NFL drafts, as he is considered one of the best quarterbacks in the country.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Conclusion><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h2><p>Dillon Gabriel is one of the most improved players in college football with a very impressive resume and record. I am sure his Hawaiian roots, faith, and family played a major role in that, and I think it will be perfect to end this piece with a quote from Dillon-</p><p>“There are three things that I represent. That’s the name on the front, the name on my back, and the state of Hawaii just because that’s what made me. I hold it heavy because I love that place. I love everything it represents, and that’s love, humility, and respect. And I’ll be that forever.”</p><p><strong>Recommended For You:</strong></p><p><a href=#>Who are Matt Campbell’s parents, Elaine and Rick Campbell</a></p><p><a href=#>Meet Spencer Rattler’s parents, Mike and Susan Rattler</a></p><p><a href=#>Meet Chip Kelly Ex-Wife, Jennifer Jenkins</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FtcbHoq2eZpOkunCvzqWjnp%2BVYrOwu9ObmKWkX5m2rbjOp2SgmZKntqa4jJ6roaaZmLa1xYyapZ1lnpbBqrvNmqOirKlk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./here-is-aubrey-plaza-plastic-surgery-before-and-after-pictures-has-the-spin-me-round-actress-lost-any-weight.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Here Is Aubrey Plaza Plastic Surgery Before And After Pictures: Has The Spin Me Round Actress Lost A">&larr;
