After all, it's one of the most successful franchises of all time. It's no wonder Disney keeps pumping out product for the masses and die-hard fans to consume. Because of this, and the fact that Star Wars means so much to so many, acclaimed actors have jumped at the chance to take part. This is particularly true of Disney+'s Star Wars TV shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the Disney Star Wars sequel movies failed to win the hearts of longtime Star Wars fans, their TV shows have fared far better. Thanks to The Mandalorian, everyone's favorite bounty hunter was given a second chance after seemingly getting killed off at the beginning of Return of the Jedi. Due to the cult-like love of the most feared bounty hunter in the galaxy, The Book of Boba Fett is set to become as successful as The Mandalorian. That means the cast members all get to breathe a sigh of relief... their bank accounts will likely never dry up. Here are the richest cast members of the Book of Boba Fett...</p><h2 id=daniel-logan-is-worth-1-million><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Daniel Logan Is Worth $1 million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Daniel Logan has made a decent living playing the younger version of Boba Fett in Star Wars: Attack Of The Clones, The Book of Boba Fett, and The Clone Wars. He's also been in one of the Sharknado movies and acted in some lesser-known projects. Perhaps the various flashback scenes on The Book Of Boba Fett will give Daniel a major career comeback.</p><h2 id=sophie-thatcher-is-worth-1---5-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Sophie Thatcher Is Worth $1 - 5 Million</span></h2><p>Sophie's precise net worth seems to be debated online but it falls somewhere between $1 million and $5 million. Either number is respectable given the relatively new career she is embarking on. However, Sophie, who plays Drash on The Book of Boba Fett, will soon become one of the most recognizable actors of her generation. Aside from her role on the Star Wars series, she is also one of the lead characters on the new hit show Yellowjackets.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jordan-bolger-is-worth-1-2-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Jordan Bolger Is Worth $1.2 Million</span></h2><p>Jordan Bolger's Skad has only appeared in one episode of The Book of Boba Fett at the time of this writing but he's likely to return.

Idol Net Worth says that the 24-year-old is closing in on 1 and a half million by the day.</p><h2 id=xavier-jimenez-is-worth-1-7-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Xavier Jimenez Is Worth $1.7 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We don't get to see much of Xavier Jimenez in The Book of Boba Fett except behind the mask of the Tusken Raider leader. The outrageously fit Miami-born actor doesn't have many credits to his name but has managed to build a $1.7 million net worth, according to Biography Net Worth. His other work includes Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and The Mandalorian. Xavier also works as a model which is how he's been able to make so much money.</p><h2 id=matt-berry-is-worth-4-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Matt Berry Is Worth $4 Million</span></h2><p>Matt Berry voices the droid 8D8 in The Book Of Boba Fett.

Of course, her character was first introduced on The Mandalorian, which helped contribute to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> her $5 million net worth</a>. The acclaimed actor has been able to build such an impressive net worth due to her lengthy career in film and television, including numerous and notable voice-over gigs such as Disney's Mulan. Ming-Na also did 118 episodes of ER, was a pivotal character in Stargate Universe and Eureka, as well as got her start on the soap opera As The World Turns.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=temuera-morrison-is-worth-5-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Temuera Morrison Is Worth $5 Million</span></h2><p>There's no doubt that the New Zealand-born Mauri actor is best-known for playing Jango Fett and his clone song Boba Fett in the Star Wars universe.

Temuera is also a massive name in the New Zealand film industry which is responsible for some of the most talented actors and filmmakers in the industry. According to Celebrity Net Worth, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Temuera is worth $5 million</a> and that number is set to grow exponentially as he continues to play the most feared and famous bounty hunter in the galaxy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stephen-root-is-worth-6-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Stephen Root Is Worth $6 Million</span></h2><p>Lortha Peel is played by one of the most recognizable faces in the film industry, Stephen Root.

Then there's Stephen's acclaimed work as Monroe Fuches in Barry, and his roles in The Tragedy of Macbeth, Perry Mason, The Man In The High Castle, The West Wing, VEEP, Fargo, Justified, and Boardwalk Empire. But Stephen has made an absolute fortune by lending his voice to animated projects like Finding Nemo and Finding Dory, Masters of the Universe, American Dad, and, of course, King of The Hill where he voiced Bill. At the time of this writing, Stephen has a whopping 264 credits to his acting resume, according to IMDb.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Swingline® Celebrates 20th Anniversary Of Office Space By Giving Away Milton’s Iconic Red Stapler</a></span></p><h2 id=jennifer-beals-is-worth-8-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jennifer Beals Is Worth $8 Million</span></h2><p>Acclaimed actor Jennifer Beals plays the cantina owner Garsa Fwip in The Book of Boba Fett.

While it's unknown if his character will return in future episodes he's worth including on this list as the cameo has gained a lot of attention. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Danny is worth $8 million. There's no doubt that this is due to his roles in Machete, From Dusk Till Dawn, and just about every B-movie known to man.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>15 Questions We Have About Boba Fett After Watching The Mandalorian</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipopuYmsC1ecCcq6iqo2LBqbGMm6aoo12ks26uzpuYZp6VqcFuusStZLCnoqm1tHnRmqWknZRk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./terrence-metcalf.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Terrence Metcalf Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Family, Brother, Wife, Son, Contract, Stats, Team, Salary, ">&larr;
