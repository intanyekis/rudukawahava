When Aaron joined the Patriots, Shayanna was attending college.</p><p>Shayanna completely supported her then-fiancé after Lloyd’s murder, although it meant going against her sister, who at the time of his death was in a relationship with Lloyd. In April 2017, Aaron Hernandez committed suicide. Shayanna has made television appearances since then to share her version of events.</p><p>Born on the 29th of May 1989.

During middle school, their relationship took a severe turn.</p><p>They started dating in 2007 and, as Hernandez became a national phenomenon, the ensuing relationship went through its fair share of ups and downs. Hernandez agreed to forego his senior year at the conclusion of his junior year and make himself eligible for the NFL season. It turned out to be an intelligent choice.</p><p>In 2010, the Patriots were recruited in the fourth round of the league. Despite the gap, Shayanna and Hernandez maintained frequent contact and she moved in with him when he eventually moved back to play for the Patriots. They were going to buy a $1.5 million house in a suburb of Boston.</p><p>Any time in early 2012, she became pregnant. They were engaged by November. On November 6th, 2012, their daughter, <a class=wpil_keyword_link title="Avielle Janelle Hernandez" href=# data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Avielle Janelle Hernandez</a>, was born. Hernandez was convicted and later sentenced to life imprisonment for the first-degree murder of Odin Lloyd and other offenses.</p><p>Shayanna took his last name after the arrest, even though they were not together. In April 2017, Aaron Hernandez reportedly hanged himself. His body was discovered at about 3:05 am in his cell on April 19, 2017.</p><p>After the death of her previous boyfriend Aaron Josef Hernandez, Jenkins is currently engaged to <a class=wpil_keyword_link title="Dino Guilmette" href=# data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Dino Guilmette</a>.</p><table width=604><tbody readability=3><tr readability=6><td>Boyfriends</td><td width=481 readability=7>Dino Guilmette (fiance), <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibio.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Dino-Guilmette.jpg><p>Long affair with late Aaron Josef Hernandez</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibio.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Aaron-Josef-Hernandez.jpg></p></td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td width=481>Unmarried (but engaged)</td></tr><tr><td>Husband</td><td width=481>None</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td width=481 readability=5><strong>Daughter –</strong> Two daughters including Avielle Janelle Hernandez<p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibio.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/shayanna-jenkins-instagramshayjhernandez1-253x300.jpg></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Here we provide you the list of Shayanna Jenkins’ favorite things.</p><table width=576><tbody readability=2><tr><td>Favorite Actors</td><td width=350>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Favorite Actress</td><td width=350>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Favorite Colour</td><td width=350>Black</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Favorite Holiday Destinations</td><td width=350>Paris</td></tr><tr><td>Favorite Food</td><td width=350>Italian Cuisine</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Favorite Things To Do</td><td width=350>Spending time with her family and Traveling</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li>Jenkins also came to know in 2012 that her fiancé with some other girl was cheating on her.</li></ul><ul><li>She left their home in North Attleborough but came back in the summer of 2012.</li></ul><ul><li>His late lover was also shown to have been diagnosed with serious chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).</li></ul><ul><li>Therefore, on behalf of Avielle Janelle Hernandez, she filed a USD $20 million lawsuits against the NFL.</li></ul><ul><li>The judge, however, dismissed the lawsuit and said that at the time he was diagnosed, Hernandez was essentially retired.</li></ul><ul><li>In a Jose Baez book “Unnecessary Roughness” about Hernandez having sexual relations with men, Jenkins also wrote a forward.</li></ul><ul><li>At the time of his death, Shayanna’s lover even wrote a suicide note to her.</li></ul><ul><li>Odin Lloyd was the boyfriend of the sister of Shayanna Jenkins Hernandez, Shaneah Jenkins.</li></ul><ul><li>Even though the former couple had never married each other, she added the surname of her late partner.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLXKopmip16qwHC%2Fx5qwmqaelnqrsc2koKerXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./wilson-radjou-pujalte.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="British Actor, Wilson Radjou Pujalte Distinctive Life But Much Common; Most Recent Role In TV Series">&larr;
