However, the sad truth is that loyal Survivor fans know that some of the show's stars have gone on to struggle a lot.</p><p>Two notable examples of that are <a href=#>the first Survivor to be medically evacuated</a> and <a href=#>Phillip Sheppard since his life went through incredible turmoil because of the show</a>. Russell Hantz says he also is an example of that, since he once blamed his divorce on Survivor.</p><p>This article will reveal <strong>why Russell Hantz blamed his divorce on Survivor</strong>. Then, the article will look at <strong>another relationship of Hantz's that at one point seemed to be ruined</strong>.</p><h2 id=russell-hantz-claims-that-survivor-ruined-his-marriage>Russell Hantz Claims That Survivor Ruined His Marriage</h2><p>Throughout Survivor history, there have been very few players who took the show by storm the way Russell Hantz did. After making his first appearance in <strong>Survivor: Samoa</strong> and controlling the game, Hantz was asked to return to the show very quickly. In fact, Hantz began filming his second season before the first one even aired.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During his second season, Survivor: Heroes vs Villains, Hantz yet again seemed to have a lot of control. This was even more amazing since Hantz was playing with an all-star cast the second time around.</p><p>Despite how much control Hantz wielded, he lost both of those seasons. During each reunion after Hantz lost, he seemed haunted by the Sole Survivor crown alluding him and obsessed with winning the show. Based on what Hantz later said during an interview, <strong>letting Survivor change him ended his marriage</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/survivor-s-natalie-white-and-russell-hantz-during-the-reunion.jpg><p>In 2018, Hantz was interviewed by an Australian magazine called Who. The reason why Hantz spoke to that outlet was because he also wound up competing in the Australian version of Survivor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>How successful was Russell Hantz on Survivor and Australian Survivor?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>Season:</p></td><td><p>Russell Hantz' Placement:</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Survivor: Samoa</p></td><td><p>Runner-Up</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains</p></td><td><p>Second Runner-Up</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Survivor: Redemption Island</p></td><td><p>17/18</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Australian Survivor: Champions v Contenders</p></td><td><p>23/24</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>While talking to that outlet, Hantz admitted that <strong>the villain persona he crafted for Survivor took over every aspect of his life</strong>. According to Hantz, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">that behavior took a huge toll on his marriage and ultimately ended it</a></strong>.</p><p>“I stayed that person for years after and that is just not a good person in real life. I didn’t go round lying, cheating and stealing, but I went around partying and everything else, so it’s just not a positive thing.

And I'm being straight-up. I want him to see this. I want him to read this. Maybe it will hit him in his head. When something good happens for somebody and nothing good has happened for you, you get a little bit bitter. And I feel like that's what it is right now.
