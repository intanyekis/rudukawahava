She was the wife of the <a href=#>Prince of Wales, Charles</a> who is the heir apparent of <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>. Princes Diana was one of the more famous twentieth century women in the world.</p><p>How rich was the Princess? It was estimated by authoritative sources that the outright size of Princess Diana’s net worth was as much as $55 million at the time of her death.</p><h3>Princess Diana Net Worth $55 Million</h3><p>To start with, Diana was born into a minor noble family. Diana had two older sisters and a younger brother. The family did not hide the disappointment after her birth, because they were hoping for a male heir, who would extend the Spencer clan. The newborn was named Diana Frances to honour the mother and one great-grandmother of the Spencers. In 1969, after fourteen years together, Diana’s parents divorced. Diana’s father received the custody of all the children. From 1974 to 1977, Diana studied at West Heath School in Kent. In 1975 after the death of the grandfather, the seventh earl Spencer, the family moved to Althorp House, with the girls assuming ‘Lady’ titles, and the son became a Viscount with their father inheriting the title of eighth Count, and Althorp House.</p><p>At the end of 1977, Diana met <a href=#>Prince Charles</a>, who was friends with Diana’s sister Sarah. In 1980, Diana was announced to be a girlfriend of <a href=#>Prince Charles</a>, and at the beginning of 1981, Charles officially asked Lady Diana Spencer to become his wife. On the 29th July 1981 Diana married <a href=#>Prince Charles</a>, the moment with the help of television watched by 750 million people in more than seventy countries. On the 21st June 1982, Diana gave birth to the second heir to the throne <a href=#>Prince William</a>, and on 15th September 1984 Diana gave birth to their second son of <a href=#>Prince Harry</a>.</p><p>In the summer of 1992, when public attention to her and the <a href=#>Prince’s</a> marriage was extremely intense, Diana began to visit hospitals. She also visited abused women’s shelters and homeless people shelters, participated in numerous charity events in Kensington Palace or elsewhere.<br>At the end of 1993, during an official charity breakfast, the Princess announced that she was withdrawing from public life, and on the 28th August 1996, <a href=#>Charles</a> and Diana marriage finally came to an end. The Princess received 17 million pounds, but she was stripped of her honorary title.</p><p>Divorced, Diana chose five areas of charity – the mission of lepers, the homeless charity, the National AIDS care, the Royal Marsden Cancer Hospital and speed Ormond STRIT children’s hospital. After the divorce, Diana dated the heart surgeon Hasnat Khan, and later Dodi Fayed. On the 31st August 1997, she was fatally injured in a car crash, and died in Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris – lots of unfounded conspiracy theories relating to her death were flying. Diana was buried in Althorp, on the island of Round Oval. Her funeral was watched on TV by 32.10 million people all over the world.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=19.705245153934><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Diana, Princess of Wales</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$55 Million</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 1, 1961 in Sandringham, Norfolk, UK</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Died</td><td>August 31, 1997 in Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, France</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5' 10" (1.78 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Princess of Wales</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Education</td><td>West Heath School in Kent, attended Institut Alpin Videmanette, a finishing school in Rougemont, Switzerland</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>British</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Spouse</td><td>Charles, Prince of Wales (m. 1981–1996)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>William Arthur Philip Louis, Henry Charles Albert David</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Parents</td><td>John Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer, Frances Shand Kydd</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Siblings</td><td>Charles Spencer, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, Jane Fellowes, Baroness Fellowes, John Spencer</td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0697740</a></td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Nominations</td><td>100 Most Important People of the 20th Century (1999, by Time magazine), Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales (29 July 1981 – 28 August 1996), Member of the Royal Family Order of Queen Elizabeth II (1981)</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Blue eyes</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Blonde hair, often short</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=28.519024390244><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>The worst illness of our time is that so many people have to suffer from not ever being loved.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2</td><td>Everyone needs to be valued.
